[Coding 2 : Webscraping] [RStudio]
**<h2>Project 1 : TechCrunch Webscraping</h2>**
*<h5>FOR MS BA 2022</h5>*


>This repository contains the detailed description of my Project 1: submission for Coding 2. I used the website, [TechCrunch](https://www.techcrunch.com).

1. <h3>Why TechCrunch?</h3>
TechCrunch started back in 2005, delivering startup news for more than a decade already. It is one of the best reliable online news sources for anything technology and startup related happenings, whether it be fundings, awards, mergers and acquisitions, strategies, hardware and software products from all around the world.  This site is a nice go to site to get started with your tech journey.  They also have their own conferences showcasing the upcoming startups and the great tech leaders of our time. 

I choose to scrape this site, for 2 reasons: first because I have been following this site for more than 10 years since 2011, and secondly, I haven't found a webscraper for it. So, I think it will be a great idea to build a scraper for it and maybe generate more analysis for it in the future ;) .

You'll find more details below. Enjoy :) All codes can be found in Project 1 repository -> [Here](https://github.com/abigailchristinechen/coding2/blob/main/projects/project1)

1. <h3>Libraries Used</h3>
    1.  Here are the libraries I used: '
        <img src= "https://github.com/abigailchristinechen/coding2/blob/main/projects/project1/Libraries%20Used.png" width="300" height="180"/>
             

2. <h3>GetLink Function </h3> 
    1.  To start, we need to go to the TechCrunch webpage, and urlF is introduced because url itself with change after reading one page.  We also have to determine the number of days we want to collect with the Days variable, for this project I decided to collect a week for of articles.  I first ran the code around Early December 2021, so the articles scraped list in the 

  
  ExitFlag = 0 # it remains zero until data till our desired date has been scraped
  
  df = data.frame() # creating a data frame which will contain all the links and their dates
  
  CurrentDate = Sys.Date() # gets the current date from the system
  
  FilterDate = CurrentDate - Days # subtracts days from the current date to get filter date
  # it is the date until which we will extract our data
  
  while(ExitFlag == 0){ # remains in this loop until falg  is 0
    
    page <- read_html(url) # reads the entire html page
    
    WebList <- page %>% html_nodes("a") %>%
      html_attr("href") ## this step gets the list of all the web link from the page scraped above 
    
    url = WebList[length(WebList)] # resetting the url to the next page, 
    #last element of the weblist  contains list to the next page of the website 
    
    ## removing the urlF from each website
    TempWebList = gsub(urlF,"",WebList)
    
    ## loop over al the links and select the ones we want
    for (i in 1:length(WebList)) {

    
    1.  Here is the Get Link function

     2. The *Salaries Dataset* contains 3 tables from which I only used the Salaries per region, because the other tables were about the various departments in the universities. Here are the details for [Table 3](https://github.com/abigailchristinechen/de1/blob/main/Term1/Table%203.png):

    Here's the [EER diagram](https://github.com/abigailchristinechen/de1/blob/main/Term1/EER%20Diagram.png) for the relationship:

3. <h3>Analytics </h3> 
   - For this project, and for reproducibility here is the -> [Analytics Plan](https://github.com/abigailchristinechen/de1/blob/main/Term1/Analytics%20Plan.png) , quick summary on the steps
        - Loading the tables
        - Creating a data warehouse called dw_uni_analysis
        - Creating data marts to achieve 15 quick views

4. <h3>Analytics Layer</h3> 
        - Here is the -> [Data Warehouse](https://github.com/abigailchristinechen/de1/blob/main/Term1/data_warehouse_etl_uni.png), consisting of 3 dimensions: Rankings, Scores and Salaries.
