2021-12-19,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/19/indian-fintech-giant-razorpay-valued-at-7-5-billion-in-375-million-funding/","Indian fintech giant Razorpay valued at $7.5 billion in $375 million funding","","Razorpay has more than doubled its valuation to $7.5 billion from $3 billion in April as one of India’s largest fintech giants demonstrates fast growth and aggressively broadens its product offerings. The Bangalore-headquartered startup, which is a market leader in payments processing in India, said Sunday evening it has raised $375 million in its Series F financing round. The new round, which brings more capital to the startup than all its other previous financings put together, was co-led by Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital and TCV. Existing investors Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, GIC and Y Combinator also participated in the new round, said Razorpay, which has raised over $740 million over the past seven years. Razorpay accepts, processes for – and disburses money to – small businesses and enterprises. It also operates a neobanking platform, through which it offers credit cards and working capital to businesses. It also offers an international payments gateway that supports over 90 currencies. Some of its other offerings include helping businesses with collating tax and compliance disbursements, generating payment links that can be shared via email or through instant messaging services, subscription plans with automated recurring transactions on various payment modes, and automatic reconciliation of incoming transactions using virtual accounts and UPI IDs. The startup — whose offerings are similar to those of Stripe, the global payments giant that has little to no presence in India — has also entered a few nations in Southeast Asia in recent years. Razorpay, which processes $60 billion in transactions annually (up from $5 billion in 2019), says it has amassed over 8 million businesses including Facebook, Swiggy, Cred, National Pension System, Indian Oil among its customers. Of the 42 startups that have become unicorns in India this year, 34 of them use Razorpay. “Our payments business continues to keep getting stronger. In the last one and a half years, we have also been able to prove our thesis on neobanking and lending,” said Harshil Mathur, co-founder and chief executive of Razorpay, in an interview with TechCrunch this week. “We want to ensure that when you start a company, and sign up with Razorpay, we do everything for you on the financial side – from opening a bank account to building payments and disbursals and salary payouts. You don’t have to step out and use multiple tools,” he added. As these businesses grow, Razorpay grows with them, he said. Mathur and Shashank Kumar (co-founder of Razorpay) — pictured above — met at IIT Roorkee college. At the time, small businesses in India faced a myriad of challenges in accepting money digitally and existing payment processing firms weren’t focused on catering the needs of them. At a $7.5 billion valuation, up from just a little over $1 billion last year, Razorpay is now one of India’s most valuable fintech startups. But getting to this stage hasn’t been easy. The co-founders struggled to convince bankers to work with them in the initial years of the startup. The conversations were slow and the co-founders felt helpless explaining the same challenges to investors numerous times, they recalled in an earlier interview. “Over the last seven years, we’ve tirelessly worked towards making Razorpay a technology and product company which is people-first. If there is one thing the Razorpay team has committed to doing since 2014, it is to never stop reinventing,” said Kumar. The startup plans to continue to focus on expanding its product offerings and also hire over 600 people to fuel its growth in India and Southeast Asia. But Razorpay, which recently introduced a feature that saves shoppers’ information — password, card details, addresses — during their first purchase and prefills those when they transact with the same business or any other that also uses Razorpay to process its payments, is not looking to offer a consumer-focused neobanking service, Mathur said. “We might do some consumer-focused stuff, but we want to stay away from pure consumer offerings for two reasons. We don’t see any huge value add that we can bring that other players in that ecosystem aren’t already offering, and also we don’t see anything significant that we can gain by entering that business,” he said. Razorpay is also gearing up to become IPO-ready, he said, but noted that the startup won’t be exploring the public markets for at least two and a half years. “As the leading online payments player in the rapidly accelerating Indian digital payments market, Razorpay has continued to innovate and blaze new trails,” said Deepak Ravichandran, General Partner at Alkeon Capital, in a statement. “With a broad set of products across payments, banking, and software that provide a seamless end-to-end experience for merchants (who have been historically underserved by legacy payment providers) and geographic expansion on the horizon, we are thrilled to be partnering with Harshil, Shashank and his team who have continued to execute on their vision. We could not be more excited for the journey ahead.”"
2021-12-19,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/19/putin-and-xis-evolving-disinformation-playbooks-pose-new-threats/","Putin and Xi’s evolving disinformation playbooks pose new threats","Moscow’s information manipulation playbook is evolving|Beijing is taking a page from Moscow’s playbook — and writing some of its own plays|Autocrats align — but only sometimes|What’s to come","The TechCrunch Global Affairs Project examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics. As the information domain becomes an increasingly active and consequential realm of state competition, two countries have gone all in. Both China and Russia have developed sophisticated information strategies to advance their geopolitical interests, and their playbooks are evolving. No longer primarily relying on proxy troll farms to generate large quantities of polarizing content, the Kremlin has turned to military intelligence assets to carry out more targeted information operations designed to circumvent platform-detection mechanisms. And motivated by concern that it might be blamed for a pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than five million people worldwide, Beijing has become considerably less risk-averse in its use of “wolf warrior” diplomats to push conspiracy theories online. To sustain its vision of a free and open internet, Washington must develop a strategy to push back. Russia, a declining power by many measures, seeks to compensate for its relative weakness through asymmetric means, by disrupting the institutions, alliances and domestic politics of its neighbors and geopolitical competitors in the near term. With little to lose and much to gain from public awareness of its activities, the Kremlin is not particularly sensitive to attribution or concerned about repercussions. And so, in order to keep the transatlantic community distracted, divided and unable to carry out a confident, coordinated foreign policy that could be detrimental to its interests, the Kremlin uses disinformation to stoke chaos and promote disorder. To accomplish this, Moscow uses at least two techniques that represent a maturation of its playbook since its “sweeping and systematic” campaign to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. First, it regularly co-opts domestic voices and institutions within target societies in order to cast information operations as authentic advocacy, often by hiding trolls within a target population, renting the social media accounts of local citizens or recruiting real activists to stoke protests. It does so partly to evade increasingly sophisticated platform-detection mechanisms and partly to exacerbate the politicization of content moderation debates within the United States. Second, the Kremlin‘s disinformers recognize that they do not need to perpetuate an operation at scale in order to create the impression that they or others have, and that the impression alone is enough to sow doubt about the legitimacy of election results and exacerbate partisan discord. Moscow can thus leverage widespread concern about the potential for manipulation, particularly in an election context, to achieve its goals by claiming that manipulation has happened — even in the absence of a successful operation. China, meanwhile, is a rising power with little to gain and much to lose from public awareness of its interference activities. Unlike Russia, it prefers a stable international order, but one that is more conducive to its interests than the current U.S.-led framework. As a result, its activities in the information domain are primarily geared toward promoting China’s image as a responsible global superpower and stifling criticism that would tarnish its prestige, while denting the appeal of democracy by casting the United States and its partners as ineffective and hypocritical. For Beijing, pursuing these interests has entailed a three-pronged strategy of piggybacking on the propaganda networks of other strongmen, manufacturing the appearance of popular support and co-opting conversations on its rights record. Lacking an influencer network of its own, China regularly relies on the constellation of alternative thinkers, many of them Western, that are a fixture of Russian propaganda. Highlighting the difficulty of generating support for pro-China positions on a platform Beijing has banned at home, China’s wolf warrior diplomats regularly engage with false personas on Twitter. And in order to push back on criticisms of its rights record, it attempts to co-opt discussions on the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang using hashtag campaigns and slick videos. Despite important differences in their long-term goals, Moscow and Beijing share multiple immediate objectives: denting the global prestige of democracy, weakening multilateral institutions and undermining democratic alliances. As a result, the two countries deploy several of the same tactics. Both use “whataboutism” to paint the United States as hypocritical, particularly on issues of race. Both use clickbait content to generate large followings on Twitter, recognizing that an audience is a strategic asset. Both regularly traffic in multiple, often conflicting, conspiracy theories to cast doubt on official accounts of political events, evade blame for their activities and create the impression that there is no such thing as objective reality. Both operate extensive propaganda apparatuses that spread their preferred narratives. They also deploy many of the same narratives. Both countries have worked to diminish confidence in the safety record of certain Western COVID-19 vaccines and portray the United States and its allies as ineffective. That said, Russia is primarily focused on pushing divisive content that deepens polarization and diminishes trust in institutions and elites, all while pushing back on what it characterizes as anti-Russian bias in established media. China, for its part, is primarily interested in highlighting the benefits of its governance model, while painting critiques of its rights abuses as hypocritical. Kremlin state media almost never cover Russian domestic politics. Moscow’s goal is to drive audiences away from the political West, not pull them toward Russia. For China, the opposite is true. Much has been made about the state of cooperation between Russia and China in various domains of their respective competitions with the United States. Evidence suggests there is very little formal coordination of their information activities beyond largely symbolic agreements to distribute one another’s content. That is not entirely a surprise. Beijing doesn’t need to formally cooperate with Moscow in order to amplify Kremlin-promoted narratives or to emulate other successful elements of the Kremlin’s information strategy. Both Russian and Chinese information strategies are evolving. Russia’s disinformation activities are becoming more targeted and harder to detect, while China is taking a more assertive, less subtle approach than before. For Russia, these changes appear to be driven by growing awareness of its activities since 2016, which simultaneously prompted the implementation of new platform policies and detection mechanisms and ushered in an era of partisan debates over election legitimacy that reverberate today. For China, changes to its information strategy seem to be primarily motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a global crisis of unique salience to its geopolitical standing that will continue to create opportunities for Beijing to test new approaches. Recognizing these consequential changes to the way Russia and China approach the information domain, the United States needs a playbook of its own. A robust strategy would include harnessing truthful information to highlight the failures of repressive rule, deploying American cyber capabilities to prevent or impose costs on those who would conduct destabilizing disinformation campaigns and implementing legislation that would make platform transparency, particularly with trusted researchers, the norm. Finally, because it is good for democratic societies and creates challenges for their authoritarian competitors, the United States should more forcefully defend freedom of information worldwide. In the consequential contest between democratic and authoritarian societies, autocrats have seized the initiative. This collection of measures represents a starting point for bold and responsible action to ensure that the United States regains it. To succeed, the U.S. and its democratic partners must act quickly.

2021-12-19,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/19/can-biden-really-crack-down-on-tech-monopolies/","Can Biden really crack down on tech monopolies?","Killer M&As|Data = money = market power|Changing the public narrative","President Joe Biden issued an executive order in July “promoting competition” in the U.S. economy. The order calls out Big Tech specifically, stating that “today a small number of dominant Internet platforms use their power to exclude market entrants, to extract monopoly profits, and to gather intimate personal information that they can exploit for their own advantage.” In November, the U.S. Senate introduced a bill targeting anti-competitive acquisitions among tech companies. There has not been a meaningful monopolization case in the United States for 20 years, but this recent momentum suggests that the current administration would like to make one stick. To date, there is still too much gray area in the rules and ambivalence among citizens to enforce antitrust law, but with a few changes to the approach, good intentions may lead to new policy, penalties and even prosecution. Over the last century, antitrust regulation lost its teeth and its broader goals have been abandoned for a nebulous standard around “consumer welfare.” The acid test for antitrust established during the 1980s reduced everything to whether alleged antitrust actions resulted in higher consumer prices. This attempt to distill antitrust into a single test of economic consequence has proven to be overly simplistic. Defenders of this singular consumer-price-based approach to antitrust evaluation cite falling prices in technology as indisputable evidence of prevailing fair competition. Breaking up tech monopolies will not be easy, but it can be done with a three-pronged approach: blocking anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions, constituting data as market power to rewrite policy and driving public interest in the topic so that citizens can elect concerned antitrust policymakers. In an era of easy money, with protracted periods of very loose monetary policy and highly inflated stock prices, buying off future competitors at inflated values is now part of the business playbook. Examples abound in the tech world, and Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are incontrovertible examples. Excessive regulation does kill innovation, but free markets depend on regulation to remain fair and free. Current law stipulates that any deal valued at or above $92 million must be reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice for review, with few exceptions. Given one of the stated intents of the Biden order is increased scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions, consumers may see more legal action taken by the government to block deals that “substantially lessen competition.” The proposed bill that would block certain acquisitions is a good sign of recognition by both sides of the aisle that there is abuse, but the bar for offenders remains high, especially when the monopolization of data isn’t widely considered anti-competitive. The FTC and the DOJ will need to exercise their ability to enforce antitrust law against Big Tech, which it can better do with this new legislation. Offering free products has turned out to be a surreptitious strategy for some tech giants to accumulate other assets — notably, personal information on their unwitting “free” customers — that has not just fed them inordinate profit streams in the multiple billions but also made these companies monopolists of exactly those assets. Search engine marketing and social media advertising were built exactly this way. Such digital assets are now rented out to all other companies as a tax on their marketing budgets — an overt example of market power. We have unprecedented concentration in most industries, and companies in industries with rising concentration are actually investing less because they can more readily exercise their market power. However, when the weather turns inclement, the fair-weather friends of self-correcting markets will readily change teams and support extraordinary market interventions, like the multiple actions taken by the Federal Reserve amid the pandemic to unabashedly prop up markets. Welcomed in the Biden executive order is the encouragement to the FTC to establish new rules on online surveillance and the accumulation of users’ data. Our monopolist tech giants have framed the rules of this game for far too long already, indulging gullible legislators in laughable oaths of self-regulation. Until mass collection and control of data are properly categorized as market power, the levers of justice will continue to favor Big Tech, not the consumer. New policy and law, in this case, will materialize only when public outcry forces legislators’ hands. Consumers and citizens are largely those most affected by lax antitrust enforcement and loose policy. Whether by forfeiting personal data, overpaying for services or not being able to choose among products, monopolies violate consumers’ welfare in one way or another. But is there anything they can do? Biden’s executive order is the direct result of increased public pressure around antitrust in this country. The same is true of the new Senate bill. Increasingly, private businesses are filing their suits against monopolies in state courts, filled with elected officials. It may sound ridiculous now, but antitrust could become a leading topic on which politicians must stump. Meaningful antitrust policy reform will come from reformers, elected by the body politic, which is why voting for candidates based on their views of antitrust enforcement will be critical to changing the status quo. We need stronger antitrust and privacy regulation now. The privacy and well-being of our citizens are at stake. Antitrust, like charity, must begin at home."
2021-12-18,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/the-big-startup-question-on-my-mind-for-2022/","The big startup question on my mind for 2022","Company culture and trying to not be the “fool in the room”|And the startup of the week is…|TechCrunch Gift Guide 2021|Across the week","Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here. As we entered 2021, I wrote about the big question on every startup’s mind for 2021: How will a cataclysmic event such as a pandemic show up in post-pandemic innovation? Well, spoiler alert: We’re nearing the end of yet another pandemic year, and it seems like this state will be our world for longer than I’d like to predict. In other words, my question didn’t age well, and today, I’d like to pose a new one. My question heading into 2022 is: How can the tech community sneak activation energy into startups, especially those built by historically overlooked founders, beyond capital? I’m not talking about hype machines or weekly luncheons on specific topics, I’m talking about more elusive services. In this cash-rich environment, I think entrepreneurs need more human resources than ever before when it comes to building their company. Don’t get me wrong, the gender gap in fundraising continues to be a blaring, embarrassing issue that venture needs to fix. But as we spotlight the need to get more checks to more founders, we also need to figure out how to keep those same founders in an increasingly competitive environment. After all, venture doesn’t fix all things — and in fact, can even complicate the growth of a startup.  Activation energy can look different every day. This week, for example, I wrote about Z Fellows, an accelerator that pays people $10,000 to take a week-long break from their day job and flirt with finally building their startup idea. The average age for a Z Fellow is 20 to 25 years old, meaning that the program has successfully convinced first-time founders to take a jump. Founder Cory Levy attributes interest to the program’s pre-requisite: You only have to take one week off from work. “The best programs out there, whether that’s Y Combinator or the Thiel Fellowship, require this high commitment, big life decisions,” whether it’s dropping out of school or going full-time on an idea, Levy said. “Don’t do that; just kind of simulate what life would be like for a couple of days or a week: If you like it, great, if you don’t, no harm no foul.” While Levy shows the importance of time, I think we’ll also see a growing importance for founders to lean on community and mental health support. For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column: More than another check, founders need activation energy.  Thank you so much for your continued readership during this wild year. We unpacked a lot together, from unicorns in need of haircuts to tech mafias in need of a modern refresh. We thought too much into dollars, thinking about hot due diligence summer and gaslighting in fundraising. We went sector specific, giving notes on why crypto doesn’t need NFTs, but NFTs need crypto and multiplayer fintech. And finally, we got transparent, speaking on why democratization can sometimes hurt more than help and how you can build vulnerability into your workflow.  It was an exhausting year, but it was one punctuated by a lot of learning (and unlearning) that will continue to shape how ideas turn into companies and realizations turn into thoughtful stories. That said, I’m excited to take a break so you won’t hear from Startups Weekly until the first full week of January. Now, for one last time in 2021, let’s jump into the rest of this newsletter. We’ll talk about diversity in money, climate versus crypto and the trucking creator economy. As always, you can follow my thoughts on Twitter @nmasc_  or my emotions on Revue.  Image Credits: filo / Getty Images Mobility reporter Rebecca Bellan recently published a nuanced interview with Ample co-founder John de Souza, who was born and raised in Ethiopia. The serial founder is building an electric vehicle battery swapping company, and as Bellan notes, the odds are against him thanks to a well-capitalized competitor. The entire interview is worth a read, but I resonated most with his notes on culture, which is apparently a big focus for him even in the heart of a red hot sector. Here’s what to know: “The issue with growing companies, especially in the Valley, is that you have high turnover, and so trying to grow the company while you’re losing is really hard. If you can stem the people leaving you can grow the company very efficiently, and so we realize the way to keep people is not just to pay them to stay, but to create company culture,” said de Souza. This line stood out because it underscores what I think will be a massive conversation in 2022: internal communications at a company, and how the great resignation changed what employees want from their companies. Culture can’t be ignored:  Image Credits: alashi (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Notus! The early-stage startup wants to help other companies identify the best journalists and influencers to work with, based on a deep scan of the social web. They even used their own algorithm to target me for their funding round announcement. Here’s what to know: The startup confirmed that Alexis Ohanian’s 776 recently led a $1.25 million round, with participation of angels from Glossier and Tesla. Ohanian pointed out that “as the internet unbundled media, influence fragmented,” which, I’d argue, makes it harder than ever for a brand to reach and truly understand their audience.

The app industry continues to grow, with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the latest year-end reports. App Annie said global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps this year than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found. Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a combined $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors poured $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that was up 27% year-over-year. This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too. Do you want This Week in Apps in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here: techcrunch.com/newsletters Apps have been accused of quietly snooping on their users for some time. They collect data and reshare it with advertisers and other third parties, often without users’ truly informed consent. Now the tables are turned in a sense, as users will finally be able to snoop on their apps, thanks to Apple’s new App Privacy Report feature, now available in iOS 15.2 and iPadOS 15.2. This app transparency feature lets an iOS user see what their apps are actually doing — including which apps are accessing the data and the sensors on your phone, as well as where that data is being shared. The latter is revealed through the feature’s ability to report with which third-party websites an app is communicating. Some of those may be for analytics purposes, but others may be adtech sites.  Image Credits: Apple To use the feature, you’ll head to Settings > Privacy > App Privacy Report then switch it on. Over time, you’ll be able to see how apps accessed your data over the past seven days, complete with timestamps for its every action. While Apple should be applauded for making this information more transparent, there’s some concern that the report will leave users feeling less empowered, rather than more empowered. Sure, a favorite app may be contacting some odd-sounding domain, but what data exactly was shared? Would the user be okay with that data sharing if it were explained? If they’re not okay with it, what are they supposed to do to stop it, other than just uninstalling the app? Apple seems to be betting on the fact that simply making this information public could push the app industry toward better behavior that’s more respectful of user privacy. But just like most users never read those long user agreements when installing software in the first place, it’s not clear to what extent this new feature will be adopted by mainstream users. Google details Android 12 Go edition  Image Credits: Google Google this week offered more details about the new features and updates that will be available when the first devices running Android 12 (Go Edition) are launched in 2022. Designed for low-end smartphones, apps on Go Edition will launch up to 30% faster and with smoother animation, Google says — that means they’ll open instantly, instead of presenting users with a blank screen. The new SplashScreen API will help Android developers provide this consistently smooth experience when their users launch their apps. The updated OS will also automatically save battery life and storage by hibernating apps that haven’t been used for extended periods of time. The Files Go app, meanwhile, allows users to recover files within 30 days so users can safely delete files when they need to free up space. Other new features include guest profiles on the lock screen; offline sharing with nearby devices via Nearby Share; a privacy dashboard that shows app activity, permissions and access to sensors; a privacy indicator that alerts you when apps are using your mic or camera; the ability to select approximate location instead of precise location when sharing your information with apps; plus the ability to listen to the news, and translate on-screen content into your language from the screen where you find your recent apps. Some of the new features were brought over from the main Android 12 OS to Go Edition, while others were designed for the needs of low-end smartphone users — a large market. Google says more than 200 million people actively use an Android (Go Edition) phone.

Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. Looking for our other guides? Find them here! 2021 was largely defined by the great resignation, in which tens of millions of people left their jobs in pursuit of other opportunities. A sliver of those folks made their next career move into a personal one: betting on themselves by going solo. As a result, we have seen the rise of solopreneurs, either as a business owner, investor, or even a journalist choosing to start their own publication, traditional newsroom be damned! Betting on yourself is an ambitious yet lonely process, so I surveyed a handful of solopreneurs to see what their gift wish lists look like this holiday season. We set no restrictions, so we weren’t sure what to expect — but what we got was a fun, thoughtful, and eclectic list of ideas; some focusing on productivity, others on comfort, and others on self-care. If there’s a running thread between them, it’s this: if you’re setting out to do things yourself, take care of yourself.

Newton, who publishes a daily guide for understanding the social networks built by behemoths and challenged by startups, is eyeing a curved monitor. Why constantly switch from window to window when you can have one mega panoramic view of everything? Price: $935 from Dell  Image Credits: Grovemade  Image Credits: Nalgene Other than her impressive commitment to hydration, Gay said that this water bottle is her favorite because it’s light, plastic and comes in a ton of colors. “Plus, if you’re a FREAK like me who uses an app to keep track of how many liters of water you drink per day, 1 bottle = 1 liter. You’re WELCOME!,” she said.  Price: $12 from Nalgene  Finally, our first snack wishlist item! Gay picked the Purely Elizabeth Grain-free Granola, which, she notes, is on the healthier end of sugar-packed options on the market right now. She says she looks forward to it everyday, which seems far more put together than my daily ice cream sandwich. Price: $7 from Purely Elizabeth  Image Credits: Alo For balance – haha – we are ending her section with a yoga mat from Alo. The company claims that it’s 100% formaldehyde-free, non-toxic and PVC-free, as well as dry-wicking and slip free. “This yoga mat is perfect (unless you have to take it places, and then it’s ‘perfect but quite heavy’),” she said. “It’s beautiful, most importantly, it’s thick enough for some at-home tabletop, and squishy enough for a lengthy savasana.”  Price: $100 from Alo  Image Credits: Dame  Image Credits: KOHLER A key to avoiding burnout, as my friends like to remind me, is to indulge in relaxation so you can show up for yourself and your team with fresh energy. That’s the vibe of this stillness bathtub, which sounds as zen as I imagine it feels.

Users receive three daily scores, one to measure how well they slept last night, one that tracks fitness activity, and finally one that tells you your readiness to take on the day. All three matter when it comes to balancing the demands of work, live and the growing overlap between the two, so if you’re into numbers and tracking the Oura ring could be for you. It also offers at-home sizing so don’t worry about losing it when you’re washing the dishes. Or do, because I still would find a way.

The investor also added that she wants a spa subscription, which… might be a bit easier to gift. Price: Please check with your local travel agent, as this could range depending on how much you plan to indulge. Let’s trade some meetings for meetups that have nothing to do with our day jobs as we enter 2022. “As a solo GP, I still yearn for the company of girlfriends to just BE, no agenda,” Burney said. She makes a good point, considering that those are the easiest plans to not prioritize sometimes simply because you know your OGs will always be there for you. Well, here’s a healthy reminder that your friends may be loyal, but they also need attention. Price: Priceless."
2021-12-18,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/rooftops-for-rent-property-owners-should-partner-with-5g-carriers/","Rooftops for rent: Property owners should partner with 5G carriers","What’s at stake in the 5G deployment race","The race to deploy 5G infrastructure has unlocked a new use for the rooftops of restaurants, hotels, residential buildings, and even hospitals and churches. These rooftops are quickly becoming prime real estate targets for telecommunication leaders eager to establish 5G technology in highly populated areas. In fact, next-generation wireless deployments are positioned to be one of the largest allocators of lease revenue in the United States over the next five years, creating a seismic opportunity for landlords and other business owners. The Biden administration has made expanding the country’s 5G infrastructure a national priority. The $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package earmarks $65 billion in funding to expand broadband coverage to rural and underserved communities. Despite its speed and power relative to other wireless technologies, 5G has a much shorter range, only reaching up to about 1,500 feet. 	 In addition to the major wireless communications providers, new entrants in the 5G deployment race include traditional cable companies and Big Tech firms. Together, these companies are forecasted to invest an additional $275 billion to deploy their 5G macro and small-cell sites. The only effective and efficient way to deploy the sheer quantity of deployment sites required is to leverage existing buildings. In other words, the solution to the 5G race is to adopt a rooftop deployment strategy. Historically, the wireless communications market has been challenging to navigate for real estate and other business owners. Wireless carriers and tower companies have in the past entered into long-term agreements that often were less than advantageous to the property owner. In many communities, there’s strong opposition to building new towers and, moreover, the construction, zoning and permitting process can be time-consuming. However, 5G technology is uniquely suited to deployment on existing building rooftops because of the reduced antenna heights for the next-generation wireless network. Now, major institutional commercial real estate owners are better positioned than tower operators for carriers to achieve a faster, more efficient solution for their wireless real estate requirements. A rooftop deployment strategy presents a solution that is mutually beneficial to the 5G carrier and the property owner. Carriers achieve their objective of deploying their infrastructure as quickly as possible in heavily trafficked areas, while property owners reap the financial benefits of leasing their rooftops and monetizing their existing buildings in new ways. The impact on the net operating income for real estate owners and the revenue generated over the terms of a potentially 30-year lease can be substantial, increasing their access to capital. In addition to collecting payments in return for leasing its rooftop to the carrier, landlords are also able to provide better services to tenants with high-speed broadband connectivity. The deployment of 5G infrastructure is critically important for the United States to keep pace and remain competitive internationally. Certainly, 5G is about faster connectivity, increased capacity and zero latency, but it’s mostly about driving innovation that will enable a range of business services from autonomous vehicles and expansion of telehealth to efficiencies in manufacturing and agriculture and improved supply chain management. With all of these benefits considered, 5G is expected to contribute over $1.5 trillion to the U.S. GDP by 2025. The Biden administration has also identified 5G technology and universal broadband as an economic equalizer for rural America. According to policy statements, rural Americans are over 10 times more likely to lack access to reliable internet compared to urban residents. In the recently signed infrastructure law, the president and Congress prioritized investments in rural broadband infrastructure to bridge that digital divide, expanding internet access to these underserved areas. Because of this emphasis, landlords with properties in rural areas could stand to benefit more from the expansion of 5G infrastructure. The path to establishing a strong 5G network across the United States will be a long one. While it need not be a deterrent, property owners partnering with 5G providers and wireless carriers should also be informed and cognizant of the cybersecurity considerations of the technology as they house the infrastructure and offer the wireless network to their tenants. In a recent Aon survey of more than 2,300 risk managers and other executives, cyber risk was listed as the No. 1 current and predicted future risk globally. Increased connectivity and 5G are the future, which means the cybersecurity industry must continue to innovate and expand its use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance defenses. We’ve also seen the creation of organizations such as Building Cyber Security to help provide guidance and a framework to improve cybersecurity resiliency in the real estate sector. For property owners to effectively monetize their rooftops and participate in the race to 5G, government and private industry must continue to work collaboratively on an expeditious deployment of 5G infrastructure, including timely review of 5G installation requests. Additionally, more work is necessary at the state and local levels to improve the zoning and permitting process for the deployment of 5G antennas. Numerous state legislatures are already considering legislation to better address and develop a 5G strategy for their constituencies, which would also provide new opportunities for landlords. There is more policy and technical work to be done to fuel the race to 5G, but the revenue opportunity for property owners is immediate and tangible. For restaurateurs or hoteliers rebounding from the economic slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, monetizing their rooftops could be the difference between shuttering their storefronts and turning a profit."

This type of scaling strategy looks more human than a check — after all, venture doesn’t fix all things — in fact, it can even complicate the growth of a startup.  Today, I want to talk about activation energy and the various resources it takes for founders to begin moving toward a goal: time, community and mental health. Bear with me; today’s topic is a more elusive concept than helping startups with content marketing or their sales pitches, but I’d argue it is necessary to help any humans, especially those in charge of others’ livelihoods, scale themselves alongside their companies.   "
2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/south-park-commons-an-anti-incubator-founded-by-early-fb-and-dropbox-engineers-gains-momentum/","South Park Commons, an “anti incubator” founded by early FB and Dropbox engineers, gains momentum","","When South Park Commons (SPC), a community of tens of engineers in San Francisco’s South Park neighborhood, came together, it mostly flew under the radar, save for a New York Times profile in 2017, a year after it was formed. Founded by Facebook’s first female engineer, Ruchi Sanghvi, she explained at the time that her ambition with SPC was to create tech’s answer to the Bloomsbury Set or Benjamin Franklin’s Junto club, where people could discuss their respective and shared experiences and hopefully form new ideas along the way. Fast forward and SPC — which went on to raise a $55 million venture fund in 2018 to back projects born by community members — says the experiment is working. It now has 450 members in the Bay Area and across the globe. It just closed a new $150 million fund from tech luminaries, as well as institutional investors. It says it also has a highly valuable portfolio. In fact, says Sanghvi, SPC’s debut fund has already returned its capital — and then some — to investors owing to Compound Labs, an open-source platform for decentralized lending whose tokens were distributed in part to early shareholders. Sanghvi says SPC has 10 to 12 other so-called unicorns across its portfolio, too. We chatted earlier today with Sanghvi and her husband and business partner, Aditya Agarwal, who was also an early engineer at Facebook before cofounding with Sanghvi a startup they sold to Dropbox in 2012 in a reported talent acquisition. (Sanghvi stayed two years as Dropbox’s VP of Operations; Agarwal, who joined as Dropbox’s VP of engineering, was promoted to CTO in 2016 and left in 2018, joining Sanghvi at South Park Commons.) We talked at some length about the evolution of the SPC community, which began in a physical space, has largely become a highly structured virtual society during the pandemic, but that remains very focused on bringing people together in real life. Indeed, Sanghvi and Agarwal believe so strongly in the power of offline interactions that in addition to their San Francisco hub, a New York location is currently in the works and they suggest that other locations could follow, including in Seattle and even Southeast Asia. As for that membership, roughly 70% of SPC members are “technical,” says Sanghvi, though she adds that the other 30% are “domain experts or have operational expertise or are even academics.” That composition is very much by design. “The funny thing is that when you talk with a great entrepreneur and ask if they want to hang out with another entrepreneur, the answer is always ‘no,'” says Sanghvi, laughing. “They want to hang out with the expert who beat the Stanford team on some AI algorithm, so having those operational experts mixed into the community is super valuable.” The connections lead to more than friendship and fresh ideas, seemingly. According to Agarwal, upwards of 50% of the organization’s members find their cofounders or founding employees within the community, which underscores another way that South Park Commons sees itself as distinctive. Unlike a Y Combinator, which meets with nascent teams, or VCs who keep tabs on operational execs at big companies, SPC says it’s focused on capturing people who are plainly talented and probably much in demand but who, though they’ve left their last gig, aren’t immediately sure of their next move and mostly just want a little time to figure it out. It’s looking to capture people whose next move is simply to freely explore ideas, squishy though it might sound. “We’re really like a learning community that helps people in the ‘negative one to zero phase’ get to the point of being able to start a company,” says Agarwal, “and if startups come out of that process, the fund invests.” Other things to know: members tend to work closely inside the community for nine months before “graduating,” meaning they’ve either raised more than a million dollars for a new startup concept, have more than four full-time employees, or they’ve taken a job. (Exploring ideas doesn’t always lead to starting companies.) When a community member does reach the fundraising phase, one agreement made early on is to give SPC the right of first refusal to invest. (Each member is also invited to invest in SPC funds if they like, and many take the firm up on this offer. According to Sanghvi, SPC’s new $150 million fund counts 100 members as investors.) As for the shape of those investments, it’s fairly standard. Agarwal says that SPC typically invests anywhere from $700,000 to $2 million dollars for 7% to 10% of the company. He also suggests that because SPC’s network is so valuable, the venture firms that tend to make subsequent investments typically make room for SPC to maintain its percentage ownership rather than dilute it for their own shorter-term benefit. Certainly, the formula appears to be working right now. In addition to Compound Labs, some of the outfits to pass through South Park Commons’ corridors (physical and virtual), include The Graph, an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data that has gained the very public support of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin; Pilot, a maker of bookkeeping software that’s now backed by Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures and valued at $1.2 billion; and Unit21, a no-code software startup that helps businesses monitor fraudulent activities and in July raised $34 million in Series B funding led by Tiger Global. In addition to Sanghvi and Agarwal, who are the outfit’s two general partners, SPC counts as investors Mitra Lohrasbpour, who previously led revenue analytics and international expansion efforts at Dropbox, and Finn Meeks, who previously spent two years as chief of staff for Sanghvi. For what it’s worth, Agarwal says that though SPC’s new fund is triple the size of its last, he doesn’t expect the team to invest any more aggressively. “Our emphasis is on quality over quantity,” he says. “If the quality happens quickly, that’s great, but that’s not the high-order play.”"

Let’s dive right in, — Greg THIS. IS. SPERTAAAAA: After spending years helping to fight fraud at Uber, a pair of engineers are taking that hard-earned knowledge and building it into Sperta, an anti-fraud “rules engine as a service” system for fintech companies. Just a few months after launch, they’ve raised $3 million to keep the ball rolling. Hevo raises $30M for its no-code data platform: Successful startups generate a ridiculous amount of data as they grow, but a lot of it tends to get locked up in each individual team’s tools of choice. Hevo taps into all of these tools and pulls that data into a “360-degree view” dashboard, allowing companies to answer complicated questions quickly — and, notably, without writing any code. Fuzey funding: Fuzey aims to be a “one-stop shop” for small businesses — think plumbers, electricians, mechanics — by handling their messages/invoices/appointments and more in one view. Anything that makes running your own business less of a stress labyrinth is a win in my book. The company has just raised $4.5 million in seed funding, bringing its total raised to $5.2 million. Cruise’s CEO is out: Longtime GM executive Dan Ammann is out as CEO of Cruise. Neither GM nor Cruise said much about the reasoning behind the departure; according to one of Kirsten Korosec’s sources, the announcement “seemed unplanned and chaotic.” Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, who was Cruise’s first CEO before shifting to a president/CTO role, will take over as interim CEO.

While this data — and the knowledge that Facebook ignored these concerns — is troubling, understanding social media’s impact on mental health isn’t all that simple. In fact, there’s a strong argument to be made that social media can offer safe, affirming spaces and connections for young people on the journey to discover themselves and their identities. These benefits are too often pushed aside while the dark consequences of social media rage on. The fact is that today’s popular social networking platforms, like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and more, are designed with monetization as a top priority. At their core, these apps encourage excessive use because more user hours on the app equal more ad support. 	
		
			The tech industry has an opportunity — and a responsibility — to make space for platforms that aren’t dependent on ad dollars.					
	
	 While some have responded to the latest backlash by declaring that spaces like Instagram should be strictly reserved for adults, I strongly believe that it’s possible to build a social media environment that is beneficial for teenagers — one that helps them discover themselves and affirm who they are; one that lets them explore their identities freely; and one that comforts them in times of darkness and helps them know they are not alone. I’m not sure this future can be cultivated by reactive features alone, but there is potential for social media giants to team up with other organizations and nonprofits to make social media a safer place for all people. While it’s difficult to imagine a world where for-profit social media is not a monopoly, it doesn’t have to be this way. It may not be realistic to eliminate ad-supported social media apps completely, but the tech industry does have an opportunity — and responsibility — to make space for platforms that aren’t dependent on ad dollars. If the number of views, clicks and ads were secondary to people’s wants and needs, we could revolutionize the way social media platforms work. Together, we could build communities that users can come to on their own terms — whether to escape pressure from other apps, connect with peers or find an accepting place where they can be themselves. While a handful of ad-free social media spaces already exist — such as Ello and TrevorSpace, The Trevor Project’s social networking site for LGBTQ+ young people — they are much smaller and have fewer features, and therefore may not attract the high volume of users who are accustomed to the bells and whistles that come with social media apps such as Instagram. There also needs to be a space online for young people to explore their identities anonymously, which is nearly impossible when social media companies prioritize ad support over their users’ mental health and well-being. Advertisers want to know exactly who is spending time on social media so they can target users based on their age, gender, behavior and identities. This becomes especially problematic for young users who want to use social media as a vehicle for figuring out who they are but can’t do so discreetly. In order to overcome this, the industry as a whole needs to make more investments in social media spaces whose purpose isn’t profit. Over the past few years, tech giants have made incredible strides in product innovation, which could be applied to other sites that give users a safe place to express themselves and find supportive communities. There’s a time and place for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other ad-supported apps, but there’s also a clear need and want for online spaces that aren’t driven by revenue. It doesn’t have to be one or the other, and we can work together to make room for both. With TrevorSpace, for example, we’ve invested in research to better understand our users’ wants and needs, without the added pressure of meeting specific revenue goals. Through this research, we’ve learned that our users look to the internet to explore their identities and value having a safe space where they can express themselves. Beyond investing in more nonprofit social media platforms, there’s also an opportunity for tech companies to apply their leading-edge AI developments to improve the user experience on social media and alleviate some of the mental health stressors caused by spending too much time online. Social media sites currently use machine learning to inform algorithms that encourage people to spend more time online, but its possibilities extend far beyond that. We know that technology has the power to support people’s mental health instead of exacerbating mental illness, so what if we used AI to give users newfound control over social media? Imagine if AI could help people find what they really need in a given moment — like guiding users to content that makes them laugh when they want to laugh or cry when they want to cry, facilitating connections between like-minded users that build positive relationships, or suggesting resources that give them skills or knowledge that positively impact their life. The majority of social media apps today use AI to determine our feeds, “for you” pages and timelines for us. However, if we instead used AI to let people guide their own journeys on social media, we could foster a fundamentally different emotional experience — one that supported their wants and needs instead of simply monopolizing their time and attention. This sounds like a no-brainer, and some may even believe this is already happening. However, as recently bolstered by former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen’s testimony, this is simply not how the content we see is curated in the current hands of social media leaders. That must change. Thanks to unprecedented innovations and research in social media, we have the technology needed to create sites that are conducive to our well-being; it’s just a matter of investing time and resources in developing them and creating space for nonprofit apps to coexist with major ad-supported apps. Looking ahead, I see the potential for social media companies to partner with nonprofit companies to develop AI that gives users control over the content they see and how they interact with it, but it would take major time, investment and collaboration from both parties. It would also require social media giants to be OK with making room for much-needed alternative apps in the space. Making social media safer and healthier for all people is a goal that many nonprofits, including The Trevor Project, are dedicated to realizing, and we would greatly benefit from social media companies’ help making it happen."

Fueled in large part by an explosion in demand for mental health services and the expansion of telehealth during the pandemic, more investors are hunting for founders who can creditably lower costs and create efficiencies in a notoriously ramshackle industry.

2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/security-flaws-wifi-gateway-hundreds-hotel/","Security flaws found in a popular guest Wi-Fi system used in hundreds of hotels","","A security researcher says an internet gateway used by hundreds of hotels to offer and manage their guest Wi-Fi networks has vulnerabilities that could put the personal information of their guests at risk. Etizaz Mohsin told TechCrunch that the Airangel HSMX Gateway contains hardcoded passwords that are “extremely easy to guess.” With those passwords, which we are not publishing, an attacker could remotely gain access to the gateway’s settings and databases, which store records about the guest’s using the Wi-Fi. With that access, an attacker could access and exfiltrate guest records, or reconfigure the gateway’s networking settings to unwittingly redirect guests to malicious webpages, he said. Back in 2018, Mohsin discovered one of these gateways on the network of a hotel where he was staying. He found that the gateway was synchronizing files from another server across the internet, which Mohsin said contained hundreds of gateway backup files from some of the most prestigious and expensive hotels in the world. The server also stored “millions” of guest names, email addresses and arrival and departure dates, he said. Mohsin reported the bug and the server was secured, but that sparked a thought: Could this one gateway have other vulnerabilities that could put hundreds of other hotels at risk? In the end, the security researcher found five vulnerabilities that he said could compromise the gateway — including guests’ information. One screenshot he shared with TechCrunch showed the administration interface of one hotel’s vulnerable gateway revealing the guest’s name, room number and email address. Mohsin reported the newly discovered cache of flaws to Airangel, but months passed and the U.K.-based networking gear maker still has not fixed the bugs. A representative told Mohsin that the company hasn’t sold the device since 2018 and was no longer supported. But Mohsin said the device is still widely used by hotels, malls and convention centers around the world. Internet scans show more than 600 gateways are accessible from the internet alone, though the true number of vulnerable devices is likely to be higher. Most of the affected hotels are in the U.K., Germany, Russia and across the Middle East, he said. “Given the level of access that this chain of vulnerabilities offers to attackers, there is seemingly no limit to what they could do,” Mohsin told TechCrunch. Mohsin presented his findings at the @Hack conference in Saudi Arabia last month. Airangel did not respond to a request for comment. Read more:"
2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/in-2021-space-investors-watched-stars-form-in-real-time/","in 2021, space investors watched stars form in real time","","The rapid expansion of the commercial space industry over the last couple of years has led early-stage investors to consider very different types of companies than they did when space startups were a novelty. The availability of more affordable rides to space, the maturity of ground infrastructure and improvements to accessibility and usability of earth observation data have combined to position entirely new breeds of space-related ventures as ripe for high-risk, high-growth investment. At TC Sessions: Space 2021, we hosted “Being There When Stars Form,” a panel discussion with three early-stage investors: Given the topic, we talked about SPACs and also focused on areas that are piquing the interest of people who are placing bets on new and emerging space-related tech companies. Something everyone shared an interest in was infrastructure, including sustainable on-orbit operations and collision-avoidance, as well as applications being developed using in-space assets that are already in operation. Find highlights from our conversation below, or scroll to the bottom for a video with the entire chat. Chad Anderson The last 10 years have been transformative for space; we’ve gone from a handful of defense contractors and a few monolithic satellites in orbit, to suddenly tons of participation by 1,600 space companies, raising a lot of capital over the last 10 years and deploying a lot of satellites. SpaceX and Starlink have launched quite a few satellites this year, as they roll out their beta version of Starlink and going into commercial production next year. And from 2020 to 2021, we’ve seen a massive uptick in the number of satellites launched. So we have tons more commercial activity that’s happening in space and no doubt, there’s 100 times more debris in orbit. So getting our arms around that is a key focus area for governments and commercial companies. Jessica Robinson The things that are most exciting to us, regardless of whether they’re here on Earth, or in space, are certainly around data. I’m sure we’ll talk a lot about that today. I think the continued opportunities and applications of AI and machine learning are particularly applicable here as well, given that you don’t want to downlink things that you don’t have to. And I think robotics is another area that for us as investors translates well, certainly there are considerations in the space environment."
2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/go-disco-ios-app-local-discovery/","Go Disco curates local events to get you doing cool stuff around town","","Foursquare’s heyday is long over, but the problem of finding cool local stuff to do lives on. Most people seem to make it work through a sometimes reluctant combination of Facebook or Instagram and word of mouth, but the reality is that there aren’t many good apps that help us get off of apps and out into the world. For Go Disco, that’s the priority. “On the simplest level, it’s an app to get you offline, together with people that you care about more,” Go Disco co-founder Sean Conrad told TechCrunch. Go Disco is an event recommendation engine, but Conrad sees the app also as a philosophical antidote to social networks that juice engagement to keep users plugged in. “… The crazy duality or irony here is the more tech has been applied to things like medicine, logistics, transportation, it’s literally like miracles. It’s saving lives and making the world more efficient,” Conrad said. “But there’s this evil side, which is the markets applied to our social lives. Despite this magical, personally vigorous device in our pocket, it’s like a nightmare for our social lives.” The app was founded by Conrad, a consumer app developer, and Jesse Berns, a data scientist. It launches today for iOS, with an Android version on the schedule for mid next year. At launch, Go Disco will only surface cool stuff to do in Los Angeles, but it plans to quickly expand to New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Miami, Portland and Austin in 2022.  Go Disco searches and sorts local events with a combined approach, blending automated systems that pull public events info with a human-powered editorial team that can find community-specific and more underground happenings that might not show up elsewhere. The company’s events aggregation tech combs through public event listings and sorts things based on relevant terms, which are then paired with terms from a list of 65 interests. When people sign up for the app, they endorse interests from the list, from stuff like rock climbing and books to the LGBTQ community and activism. Conrad emphasized the importance of human touch in Go Disco’s recommendations, noting that it’s also a way for the app to be sure the recommendations are inclusive and thoughtful. It’s also meant to make the app’s recommendations more personalized and community-focused than a catch-all events calendar that puts the decision making burden on the user. For Go Disco, less is more. Rather than being a comprehensive guide to everything happening in your corner of the city, the app aims to serve you a small selection of the stuff it thinks you’ll enjoy most. “We don’t need to have everything… we just need to show people three or five perfect niche things,” Conrad said. ”The perfect app is you pull it up, the thing you want to do is right there and you’re done.” The first version of the app launches today, but the team has plans in the works to deepen the experience by building in a social layer. By March of next year, Go Disco plans to add a way for users to communicate about upcoming events with each other in threaded replies on the app, though for now they’ll need to settle for normal sharing and calendar features. With an added social layer, Go Disco aspires to get people out of the kind of arduous text threads that they might use to coordinate with groups of friends and into something purpose-built to connect people to events around them. With event-specific conversations, you can pop in and out of what’s relevant without needing to track back in an endless, disorganized group text. “You know, I’ve got my rock climbing friends and my foodie friends and my live music friends. Some of them overlap, some of them don’t, but I don’t want three extremely noisy text threads on this,” Conrad said. “I would like the ability to engage with those friend groups and stay connected to them. But I also don’t want to go to every single live music event that all my live music friends want to go to.” Go Disco is still early days, but it has some ideas about how it would and wouldn’t like to make money. The app won’t sell user data and would prefer to take a cut of ticket sales or charge dedicated users for premium features. Conrad emphasizes that Go Disco would want to be thoughtful if it implemented promoted events, since the whole project depends on thoughtful curation. Keeping the signal to noise ratio healthy is key, as is a focus on connecting people in real life — ideally to make them happier.

Native ads, mobile targeting, social media — over the past decade, all of these channels have been touted as the long-sought miracle for marketers and advertisers to break through the noise. Now, with at least one connected TV (CTV) in 80% of U.S. households, advertisers are ready to realign their hopes once more. With seemingly high-quality content and a large reach, CTV — often powered by Google Chrome, Roku, Apple TV or other devices — seems like a good ad bet on its face. And with the looming possible obsolescence of third-party cookies triggering panic over ad targeting on desktop and mobile, CTV offers attractive inventory. But there may be a big downside for those not willing to perform due diligence: It can be easy to fall victim to bad actors exploiting the hype CTV is currently experiencing. For ad buyers — especially those at startups and more agile organizations — CTV can be a viable and powerful channel to add to your advertising mix. But first, it’s imperative to know that CTV advertising can carry unique risks. Don’t get carried away by the hype, or taken advantage of by frauds. Investing the time and resources to get CTV advertising right before committing further is a smart strategy. CTV can reach new and niche audiences, but transparency can be challenging. CTV ads don’t provide the technical visibility of ads on desktop and mobile — often, there’s no client-side tracking of when an ad is served. This lack of transparency is just one of the risks uneducated CTV ad buying can bring. To get a more complete picture of the problem, we need to examine both the business and technical factors that make CTV unique:"

Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. We’re just starting to roll out this year’s gift guides, so check back from now until the end of December for more!  If you can’t read a good book without stopping every few pages to tweet about it, you might be what we call Extremely Online. You unabashedly distinguish between real life and digital life by using phrases like IRL versus URL, you disabled the Screen Time app on your iPhone because you don’t need that kind of judgement. Maybe you’re so online that it’s your job to write about social media, and even when you’re not working, you’re still thinking about the vice grip that Meta has on your life. Okay, that last one hit a bit too close to home. But if you’re someone who would gladly read a dissertation on what the Steak-umms Twitter account means for digital advertising strategy, I’ve got bad news for you — that gold mine doesn’t exist yet. Still, some great writers — from inside Silicon Valley and from firmly outside of it, through fiction and non-fiction — can bring us offline to teach us about tech culture. Here are some relatively recent books that confront everything from the rise of TikTok to a fictional metaverse gone wrong. This article contains links to affiliate partners where available. When you buy through these links, TechCrunch may earn an affiliate commission.  Image Credits: Doubleday Here are the basic facts: book told exclusively through Slack messages, antagonistic Slackbot inhabits human’s body, human gets trapped in Slack, all his co-workers think it’s just a really elaborate bit, chaos ensues. I’ve read this book twice this year, once as an e-book (yes, it really is just a bunch of Slack messages, no other exposition), and once as an audiobook, which features an ensemble cast performing as all the various Slack chatters. Both were lovely experiences. You might see “Slack book” and think it’s just a belabored treatise on how ~capitalism and the corporate world are eating us alive!~. This definitely isn’t a pro-capitalist book, but even as it tackles serious themes about our generation’s complete inability to understand how to create a work-life balance, it never feels overwrought, since it’s just so hilarious and absurd. Do you know how weird it looks to (1) read a book on the Philly bus and (2) laugh out loud at the book you are reading on the Philly bus? This book did that to me. ‘Several People Are Typing’ is the Slack workspace of your worst nightmares  TechCrunch interviewed Calvin Kasulke (via text), where he shared some incontrovertible truths, like, “Capitalism is bad and bodies are prisons, but the only thing worse than having one is not having one.” But perhaps more importantly, Kasulke said: “Meatball subs are as good a reason to have a physical form as anything. Top 5 reasons to stay tethered to this mortal coil.” Price: $18 from Amazon  Image Credits: MCD When this buzzworthy memoir about working in Silicon Valley came out last year, I deliberately chose not to read it, even though Goodreads kept telling me I would like it (semi-related: startup founders trying to “disrupt Goodreads” — I see you, and I appreciate you). I felt like I didn’t need a book to tell me something I already know: that startup culture can be toxic and misogynistic and that tech companies own too much of our data, because yes, we know that Browser A is better privacy-wise than Browser B, but what about all of our customized bookmarks and plugins? Even though none of these revelations were particularly shocking, Wiener’s perspective on the tech world as a non-technical startup employee was a reprieve from the corporate jargon that litters my inbox every day. But the book isn’t so much about what it’s like to work in the Valley as it is about the experience of being a 20-something who just wants to work an innocuous, creative job that doesn’t hurt people, only to be seduced by the lucrative paychecks of the tech world, which may or may not hurt people. Wiener’s memoir begins as she slogs through a publishing gig in New York City, struggling to make ends meet while her bosses are taking lunch meetings at upscale bars and wearing designer clothes to the office. But you can’t blame her for abandoning her artsy college friends to move to the Bay and learn what MAUs are. It becomes clear to Wiener that it’s seemingly impossible to make it in fields like publishing or arts administration if your parents aren’t paying your rent. So what’s more evil: a corporate world that promises creative fulfillment and instead delivers inescapable student loan debt, or one that is wreaking havoc on the Bay Area and pushing longtime residents out of their homes but at least pays its workers well? So, I guess the book didn’t really teach me anything new — there’s no ethical consumption under global capitalism, blah blah, we’re all complicit, et. al. But it’s at least nice to know you’re not the only one having an existential crisis about these things, I guess? Don’t worry, I’m fine. Price: $12 from Amazon  Image Credits: Riverhead Books A nameless protagonist goes viral for posting, “can a dog be twins?” Of course, she becomes famous on the internet. It’s good content. The first half of the book is told in post-ironic, somewhat nihilistic online-speak that feels mind-numbing. It’s the novelistic embodiment of doomscrolling. But when tragedy strikes close to home, the narrator is suddenly unconcerned with what’s going on in “the portal,” which is basically Twitter. Like “Several People Are Typing,” “No One Is Talking About This” is eerie in its mimicry of how Extremely Online people actually experience the internet. You’re sucked in, until suddenly, you’re not. Price: $23 from Amazon  Image Credits: Dutton Hank Green was one of the first YouTube stars, going on to found the YouTube conference VidCon and a bunch of other companies, like a charity sock subscription and an educational video company. He’s also weirdly popular on TikTok, so if anyone knows how the internet can change your life, it’s Hank, the enthusiastic nerd who probably taught you chemistry in high school. Anyway, Green’s online footprint is relevant because his duology of “An Absolutely Remarkable Thing” and “A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor” is all about the internet (yes, the book I am recommending you is a sequel, which means you have to read two whole books). The first book chronicles (minor spoiler alert?) an overconfident 20-something’s rapid rise to global fame as she goes viral for unwittingly making first contact with aliens. April May, this struggling recent grad-turned-superstar, must reckon with what it’s like to go viral overnight — and now, in part thanks to TikTok, this experience is more relatable than ever. But the second book, rather than the first, is highlighted on this list, because that was the story I couldn’t stop thinking about when Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Facebook/Meta’s plans for the Metaverse (it also might be relevant that I weirdly haven’t read “Ready Player One”). In the second book, April and her friends try to take down a wealthy tech founder whose virtual reality platform is a front for far more nefarious plans. In one section of the book, Andy sinks deep into the VR “Altus Space,” where a leaderboard tracks which user can make the most money by selling goods in the space’s digital currency. The top 50 people on the leaderboard are promised an earth-shattering, “premium” experience. Andy climbs the ranks by adding value to the community, but he’s thwarted by celebrities who sell limited edition virtual trinkets in a last-ditch effort to win the contest. Without ever mentioning crypto, NFTs or DAOs, Green reminds us that the decentralized internet is not inherently utopian. As Andy’s girlfriend points out, since when has capitalism been a meritocracy? Price: $16 from Amazon  Image Credits: Knopf Every book on this list was published in 2020 or later, but “Bad Blood,” released in 2018, is the exception. Over three years since the non-fiction book was published, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes is now being tried for criminal fraud, and things are getting spicy. So, if you’re Extremely Online, you’re probably going to hear about Elizabeth Holmes and her tiny vials of blood. An investigative reporter at the Wall Street Journal, John Carreyrou published an exposé in 2015 revealing that Theranos, valued at $9 billion, didn’t actually produce accurate results through its blood testing technology. “Bad Blood” reveals how Carreyrou reported the story, including details from his research that didn’t make his original articles. Whether you’re eagerly watching Holmes’ trial unfold or you’ve never heard of Theranos, “Bad Blood” is a must-read for anyone interested in (or nervous about) the pitfalls of Silicon Valley culture. It’s almost too fascinating and horrific to be real. Price: $12 from Amazon  Image Credits: Atria Books Here’s another fiction selection, but this one comes screeching with trigger warnings: eating disorders, suicide, cults, you name it. But it’s also worth noting that Alex McElroy approaches these sensitive topics responsibly, even writing an essay in The Atlantic about how to broach eating disorder narratives without tacitly providing readers with instructions on how to mimic dangerous behaviors. In the case of this novel, McElroy addresses a character’s eating disorder by showing how his friends react to his suffering, rather than chronicling his exact symptoms. “The Atmospherians” is so Extremely Online enough that its book cover is literally Instagram, but much of the book takes place in the woods. After a beauty influencer gets “cancelled” on social media, she starts a cult with her childhood best friend, where they attempt to reform “bad men,” teaching them to unlearn the behaviors of toxic masculinity. But maybe the most online moment is when the narrator is offered a lucrative contract to be the spokesperson for a product that wants to change social media by asking people, “are you sure you want to post that?” before they say something that might offend people. It’s not too far off from real-world warnings that exist on Twitter and Instagram. Price: $18 from Amazon  Image Credits: Grand Central Publishing If you’re Extremely Online in that you play a lot of video games, you’ve probably heard about how the gaming giant Activision Blizzard, which produces games like Candy Crush, Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, is facing SEC investigations and sexual harassment scandals. But Jason Schreier’s reporting reveals that this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problems in the video game industry. The start of the book can feel a bit depressing as Schreier recounts numerous stories of game studios closing without notice, developers struggling between jobs and staff being poorly compensated for 70-hour work weeks. But the book’s subtitle delivers on its promise to chronicle not just ruin, but also, recovery! Ultimately, Schreier creates a hopeful narrative. You’ll never look at Bioshock Infinite the same way after learning how bad things got behind the scenes, but Schreier shows how independent studios, unionized teams and outsourcing studios like Disbelief can help solve the toxicity of the video game industry. Price: $16 from Amazon  Image Credits: Knopf I knew that the definitive pandemic-era work from home book was coming, but I’m glad it was written by Charlie Warzel, who writes the Extremely Online Galaxy Brain newsletter, and Anne Helen Petersen, author of that viral “millennial burnout” article-turned-book. Thankfully, Warzel and Petersen’s book is less about ~these unprecedented times~ and more about how the culture shift of the pandemic can maybe be an opportunity to solve issues that have existed in the corporate world since before we wore masks every day. “Capitalism is inherently exploitative, but it is also — at least for the immediate future — our guiding economic system,” the pair writes. “If we’re going to live under it, how can we bend it to make that experience involve less suffering?” “Out of Office” focuses more on “knowledge workers” than, let’s say, an Amazon fulfillment center employee. But, bonus recommendation if you’re itching to get radicalized about awful capitalism: “On the Clock: What Low-Wage Work Did to Me and How It Drives America Insane” by Emily Guendelsberger.

It’s February 2019. The British writer remembers of the time, “I know that TikTok is popular, but only in the way that people outside of the U.S. know that the NFL pays astronomical salaries without ever getting a grip on it, or comprehending why anyone would care about it.” How quickly things changed for us all. Now, with over 1 billion monthly active users, TikTok feels like something that’s always existed, yet its prevalence is still relatively new. Trillion-dollar companies like Meta look at TikTok like the popular kid who just transferred schools and threatens to upend its seemingly impenetrable social dominance. How did this happen, and with a Chinese app nonetheless, in a time when Western xenophobia is horrifyingly rampant?

2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/tiktok-is-launching-delivery-only-restaurants-across-the-u-s-in-march/","TikTok is launching delivery-only restaurants across the US in March","","TikTok is preparing to launch a new service that will turn its viral food videos into meals you can actually order and enjoy. The social app is partnering with Virtual Dining Concepts and Grubhub to launch “TikTok Kitchen”-branded delivery-only restaurants across the United States next year, as first reported by Bloomberg. The menu at the restaurants will draw upon the most popular viral food posts on TikTok, which people can then have delivered to their door via Grubhub. TikTok plans to launch around 300 locations that will start delivering dishes in March, with plans to open more than 1,000 restaurants by the end of next year. The initial menu will include top TikTok viral dishes like baked feta pasta, a smash burger, corn ribs and pasta chips. The baked feta, in particular, gained incredible traction in 2021 as Google reported it was the most-searched dish of the year after it gained immense popularity on TikTok. Going forward, the menu at the locations will be amended quarterly with new dishes that have started to go viral. It’s unknown whether TikTok will choose to make some popular dishes, like the baked feta pasta, permanent offerings on the menu. TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch that creators will be receiving credit for dishes within the menu and will be featured prominently throughout the partnership. “Proceeds from TikTok Kitchen sales will go to both support the creators who inspired the menu item and to encourage and assist other creators to express themselves on the platform in keeping with TikTok’s mission to inspire creativity and bring joy to its users,” TikTok said. The company clarified, however, that this was more of a campaign to bring TikTok food to fans, and not TikTok’s venturing into the restaurant business. That means the company likely sees this as more of a marketing effort, rather than a long-term business. TikTok didn’t say how long this “campaign” will run, or provide other details about the ordering process, or how the menu items will be selected and refreshed. Founded in 2018, Virtual Dining Concepts runs several delivery-only ghost restaurants and has partnered with many notable individuals, including YouTube celebrity MrBeast (who runs his own virtual restaurant business, MrBeast Burger), Guy Fieri, Steve Harvey, Mariah Carey, Tyga and others. The company also has a partnership with Barstool Sports. In October, Virtual Dining Concepts raised $20 million in Series A funding, saying it planned to use the investment to fund additional technology, enhance corporate infrastructure and provide additional marketing and customer support. TikTok is widely known for popular food trends and is home to many viral recipes that are often reshared on other social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. The short-form video app’s latest partnership indicates that the company is looking to take advantage of this popularity to raise the profile of its brand and those of its creators who are fueling the food content on its app. Update: The article was updated to include information about TikTok’s partnership with Grubhub."

While a number of schools responded to the trend by closing their doors, many local law enforcement agencies and at least one federal one have weighed in, disclosing that the threat doesn’t appear to be substantiated. The Department of Homeland Security noted that it is aware of reports of a possible threat to schools though did not find any “specific, credible threats.” Still, the agency encouraged that “communities remain alert.” DHS will continue to monitor and keep the public and our partners informed. Individuals should report suspicious activity to local law enforcement. If you see something, say something.https://t.co/2Lqk9Yrcui — Homeland Security (@DHSgov) December 17, 2021  TikTok first noted the viral rumor on Thursday, stating that it was communicating with law enforcement but had “not found evidence of such threats originating or spreading via TikTok.” While it’s true that the threat itself is nowhere to be found on TikTok, posts spreading fear around the possibility of violence on December 17 abound and likely account for the viral rumor’s swift nationwide spread. “I luv you guys pls stay safe on dec 17,” one post under a related TikTok hashtag stated. In the comments, the video’s creator explained that “Ok so for everyone confused there’s shooting [threats] and bombing threats on dec 17 in schools in the usa my school was threatened 2 times.” Followers chimed in with stories of recent bomb threat scares in their own schools. TikTok revisited the situation Friday morning, stating that in coordination with the FBI and DHS it was still unable to track down a credible threat that could have kicked off the viral rumors. 1/ Update: we've exhaustively searched for content that promotes violence at schools today, but have still found nothing. What we find are videos discussing this rumor and warning others to stay safe. — TikTokComms (@TikTokComms) December 17, 2021    Around the U.S., school districts and law enforcement addressed the rumors, mostly urging caution while emphasizing that no specific threats have surfaced. Florida’s Lee County Sheriff responded to the viral rumors with a TikTok video discouraging “fake threats,” like the frequent bomb threats a number of U.S. schools regularly receive. “There is no credible information that this threat is in anyway related to any school in the State of Illinois,” an Illinois police department tweeted Thursday. “The Glenview Police Department patrols all our school grounds daily and will continue to do so. We encourage everyone to remain vigilant and report suspicious activity.” While the rumors couldn’t be substantiated, schools in a number of states closed their doors Friday, including in California, Texas, Minnesota and Connecticut. In school districts that remained open, some instructed students to leave their backpacks at home out of an abundance of caution. Across the country, local and federal law enforcement continues to monitor the situation.

2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/cove-tool-raises-30m/","Coatue, Robert Downey Jr. fund cove.tool’s design tools for sustainable building","","While there is plenty of technology out there to help make a building more sustainable, the ability to incorporate features into its design can be easier said than done. Enter cove.tool, a startup that wants to make sure buildings are sustainable by design from the moment of inception. The Atlanta-based startup, which has raised $30 million in a Series B round of funding led by Coatue, claims that in 2021, its software helped design and construction professionals avoid 5x more carbon than Tesla.  Robert Downey Jr.’s FootPrint Coalition also participated in the financing, along with existing backers Mucker Capital, Urban Us and Knoll Ventures. The round was pre-emptive, according to CEO and co-founder Sandeep Ahuja, and brings the company’s total raised to $36.5 million. While she declined to reveal valuation, she did say it was up “10x” from the company’s $5.7 million raise in November of 2020. As a B2B SaaS company, cove.tool gives architects and contractors the ability to input the details of a project and its lot and get recommendations for how to optimize for daylighting, HVAC systems, solar and materials, among other things. Powered by machine learning, cove.tool is designed to give architects, engineers and contractors a way to measure a wide range of building performance metrics while reducing construction cost. “The whole reason why we exist is to reduce the carbon emissions within the building environment because about 40% of all carbon emissions is buildings,” Ahuja told TechCrunch. “The whole goal of cove.tool is to make the process of material selection and building simulation much, much simpler so we can allow people to pick better material alternatives that are not only low carbon, but also cost optimal.” Cove.tool launched the beta version of its software in August 2017. Today, more than 25,000 projects are being built using cove.tool’s software — everything from warehouses to data centers to office buildings. The software has more than 15,000 users across 30 countries, including architects, engineers, contractors and building product manufacturers such as HDR, AECOM, Skanska and Stora Enso.  “Through streamlined automated analysis that helps architects, engineers, contractors and building product manufacturers use data-driven design, cove.tool is making the built world sustainable and efficient in the fight against climate change,” Ahuja said. Impressively, Cove.tool says it has offset 28.5 million tons of carbon this year, the equivalent of planting and growing 450 million trees for 10 years. The startup plans to use its new capital to expand its suite of products, keep adding to its 60-person team and provide carbon reduction analysis for the architecture, engineering and construction industries.  Ahuja said the company’s core competitors are consultants that are performing similar work manually. “Our differentiator is the ability to democratize access to data and be able to do something in 30 minutes that once took 2-4 weeks,” she added. While the company is not yet profitable, it could be if it stopped scaling operations, according to Ahuja. “In the months to come, we will further expand our product suite, offering integrations across the AEC ecosystem, making performance data even more accessible. We see that the carbon problem is a data problem,” she told TechCrunch. “By using API frameworks we can significantly simplify the practice of analyzing building data and sharing that data with the many professionals across the building and design process, ultimately, empowering seamless collaboration and improving project outcomes.” It also plans to scale its sales and marketing efforts within the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the EU. Robert Downey Jr., founder of FootPrint Coalition, noted that the construction and operation of buildings accounts for 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  “By combining energy efficiency, design and transparency for material selection cove.tool addresses this massive problem,” he wrote via email. “It’s a prime example of a scalable business that employs machine learning and principled leadership to literally build a better future.” Coatue Partner David Cahn said his firm believes sustainable construction is one of the most important environmental challenges today. “Cove’s software-driven approach has the potential to make architecture both easier and cleaner,” he wrote via email."
2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/backed-by-former-facebook-and-twitter-execs-tagg-launches-social-branding-app-for-gen-z/","Backed by former Facebook and Twitter execs, Tagg launches social branding app for Gen Z","","Gen Z isn’t satisfied with the social media they grew up with, so they’re building the apps that they want to use. A “social branding” app for creative teens and twenty-somethings, Tagg is announcing a $2 million seed round today from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, Facebook’s former VP of International Growth Ed Baker, TripAdvisor founder Stephen Kaufer, Pillar VC and more. Founded by recent alumni of Brown University and the neighboring Rhode Island School of Design, Tagg is still in private beta with thousands of users, and thousands more on a waitlist. It’s like a link-in-bio service, but with a social element that encourages young creatives to connect, collaborate and develop friendships. “In the digital world, the more authentic your brand, the more genuine your connections. Current social platforms fall short as they were not built for this evolving intersection of branding and connecting,” the company explains. “Tagg is building and growing an environment allowing for full creative expression of oneself — no restrictions, no stigma.” Depending on what you want to use your profile for (you might want a social profile, or you might want to promote your art and network), you can choose from five profile skins when you onboard into the app. From there, you can customize your page, then follow people and post content like you would on any other app. But on Tagg, there’s no like count on posts, which is an intentional design choice. “We do not have likes — just comments, sharing and views — because we want our creatives focused on being their favorite selves with no stigma,” co-founder Victor Loolo told TechCrunch. Especially among the Gen Z audience that Tagg is built for, users don’t always want like counts, since they know it can encourage them to compare themselves to peers in a superficial way. Even U.S. Senators like Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have introduced legislation that would ban like counts for social media users younger than 16, because it might harm teens’ mental health.  Image Credits: Tagg Tagg’s “social branding” marketing might seem counter-intuitive at first glance — the concept of branding might sound like you’re putting yourself in a box. But by design, Tagg encourages its users to grow out of their comfort zones. Even though users build their profile through using preset skins, these are only suggestions — if users want to build their profiles from a blank slate and create their own categories to organize their content with, they can do that. “Profiles can look like anything, that’s the beauty of it. We wanted to move away from the traditional, restrictive, cookie-cutter profiles that all social apps have, because as Gen Z-ers, we value freedom of expression and uniqueness a lot,” Loolo explained. “We wanted to find a happy, user-friendly medium between a traditional profile and a blank page, which would be challenging for a lot of people, so we went with profile skins.” Tagg was inspired by Loolo’s own experience as a football player at Brown, where he felt that it was difficult to define himself outside of his identity as a student athlete. That’s what inspired him to build Tagg, alongside co-founders Blessing Ubani and Sophie Chen. “People are kind of put into a box. Let’s say I’m a guy who does cooking videos on TikTok — I’m the cooking video guy. But I might enjoy video games and other stuff,” Loolo told TechCrunch. “We wanted to break away from that and allow for these creatives to curate more holistic pictures of themselves.”  Image Credits: Tagg Tagg users currently earn points by engaging with the platform — while these points are currently just a vanity feature, Loolo sees this as a potential future for the app. “Although Tagg is not currently decentralized or tokenized, the principles of our platform mirror web3’s values,” Loolo said. “One of our goals is to help our creatives understand that being directly rewarded for their content sharing and community participation is the solution to the issues of creator economy, as opposed to underpaying creator funds and inconsistent brand deals.” In the future, Tagg could move toward allowing users to earn a coin or token with value. But for now, Tagg is focused on onboarding more users from its waitlist and acquiring more users. After graduating from college in 2020, the team moved to the Bay Area, where they have continued to work on the app. With its recent funding, the app is hiring to expand its team. Recently, Steven Fang joined Tagg as a CTO and co-founder, bringing 15 years of engineering experience."

2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/are-nubanks-low-ipo-fees-a-sign-of-the-times/","Are Nubank’s low IPO fees a sign of the times?","Increasing competition around exits is favoring companies|Hot or not","Fees on the Nubank IPO were among the lowest of the year, Bloomberg revealed this week. Of the $2.6 billion the Brazilian fintech’s parent company, Nu Holdings, raised in the operation, only 1.6% are going to its underwriters, which included Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and others. “Among 490 IPOs in the U.S. so far this year, only three paid a smaller percentage,” Bloomberg noted. The Brazilian press was quick to report that Nubank got itself “a bargain.” Their term, but it did indeed land a better deal than three other Brazilian fintechs that went public before it did: PagSeguro, which IPO’d on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018; StoneCo, which shed a lot of value since its 2018 IPO; and broker XP, which went public in 2019. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. According to Bloomberg, these respectively paid 2.4%, 3.6%, and 4.3% in fees. The difference is also stark in absolute terms, with Nubank set to pay $41.6 million in commissions and discounts, compared to $83.2 million for XP. While this might speak of Nu’s bargaining power — and that its exit was one of the hottest operations of the year — it got us thinking: Could it also be a sign of some of the changes we are planning to track in 2022? Let’s explore. IPO fees are subject to market dynamics. But it’s not merely the total fee percentage that matters; other elements can also show a company’s market strength viz banks competing for its IPO business. For example, when DoorDash went public just over a year ago, The Exchange noted that the company had “no shares set aside for its underwriting banks to buy at its IPO price.” Normally, underwriting banks get the option to purchase a block of shares at a company’s final IPO price if they so choose. This gives the banks something akin to an avenue to free profit if the company they are helping take public performs well. Briefly: If underwriting banks secure access to, say, 5 million shares in an IPO, and the company prices at $20 but opens at $30, the banks can lock in a neat $50 million. Obviously, it’s more complicated than that, but illustrative math can deobfuscate. "

The move represents an important landmark for FedEx in its stated goal to be have an all-electric delivery fleet and be carbon neutral around the world by 2040. “The delivery of the first BrightDrop EV600s is a historic moment, born out of a spirit of collaboration between two leading American companies,” said FedEx’s chief sustainability officer Mitch Jackson. “[T]ransforming our pickup and delivery fleet to electric vehicles is integral to achieving our ambitious sustainability goals announced earlier this year.” FedEx was announced as a key customer for the Brightdrop EV600 vans and has been testing Brightdrop’s electric EP1 pallets over the last while. GM, which owns Chevrolet and Cadillac, spun out the Brightdrop business unit early this year. “The EV600 combines the best attributes of a traditional and a step-in van into one vehicle, keeping driver safety, comfort, and convenience top of mind,” said Brightdrop CEO Travis Katz. “It’s also the fastest built vehicle, from concept to market, in GM’s history.” The all-wheel-drive EV600 has 600 cubic feet of cargo space and can go up to 250 miles on a charge. Inside, drivers get a security system in the cargo area, auto-locking doors and motion-activated interior lighting. They also benefit from automatic emergency braking and parking assistance. The EP1 is a kind of trolley often found in stores an warehouses, with 23 cubic feet of space and an electric motor that makes it easier to move heavy objects. The first five EV600s are being delivered to FedEx’s Express facility in Inglewood, California. To support them FedEx is building charging stations across its network of facilities, including 500 already installed across California. It’s also working with utility companies to evaluate electrical grid capacity required for its charging infrastructure. While FedEx has thrown its electric delivery lot in with GM, rival UPS has ordered 10,000 electric delivery trucks from UK-based Arrival Ltd. Amazon, meanwhile, placed an order for 100,000 Rivian electric delivery vans and even owns a 20 percent piece of the company. Amazon is ahead of both FedEx and UPS, having already started Rivian electric deliveries in both Los Angeles and San Francisco. Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on Engadget."

Today, the company, founded in 2019, announced $2 million in seed funding by backers that included La Boulange’s Pascal Rigo, Petrus Winery’s Jean Moueix, Bakerly’s Bruno and Julien Caron and the Newlab. Fraîche (pronounced like crème fraîche), aims to bring healthier food items into workplaces. It places an auto-stocking smart fridge inside offices and teams up with eateries, like Le Botaniste, Egg Shop, Pressed and La Fermiere to provide the food. It will also offer its own private label products in the future, Tximista Lizarazu, CEO at Fraîche, told TechCrunch. All companies have to do is determine how much they want to subsidize per employee, and Fraîche will stock and refill the fridge every day. Employees can also download an app to access the fridge’s contents. One of Fraîche’s early investors, Romain Afflelou, co-founder of Cosmo Connected, said he liked the momentum that the company had and how it was leveraging that companies are ready to spend more money on their employees. He typically invests in companies that are connected with the world of tomorrow in terms of how people move, eat and heal.  Fraîche’s mobile app. Image Credits: Fraîche “Fraîche provides all of the food options at the office, and employees can get more affordable food that is fresh and cleaner,” he added. “You can have meals Monday through Friday inside the same place and get different products each day.” Meanwhile, many office cafeterias shut down during the global pandemic and were unable to staff up when they could reopen, Lizarazu said. Even his own company was not immune to the effects: Fraîche initially lost all of its locations, but saw the tides turn about four months later. As a result, you might think that with the Omicron variant keeping people at home a little longer, something like Fraîche would not work. However, when asked, Lizarazu said the company just needs to have 30 people in an office to make what they do work. And, if 15% to 20% of offices don’t return ever, he is still optimistic with 80% of the market remaining, he added. “Companies want to make their offices a better place, want to convince people to come back,  and have more of a budget for health and wellness,” Lizarazu said. “Right now the market is shifting, and we are starting to sell more and move faster. We spent 2020 investing in technology and building the product, and now we are ready to deploy it.” Though the company has only been operating for a few months, it is already seeing customers using the fridges three to four times a day to get meals and snacks. Lizarazu forecasted that companies would spend $5,000 a month, but is seeing double that. Fraîche’s revenue is between $80,000 and $150,000 per machine per year, which includes servicing of the fridge and the food delivery, which he says is equivalent to what New Yorkers currently pay to order out for food and have it delivered, but in this case, with less of the friction. This latest round gives the company $3 million in total funding. Workplaces including Tikehau Capital, Silverstein Properties, Newlab, Brooklyn Navy Yard, Ardian and Ogury are using Fraîche, and Lizarazu notes three more will open in January. He expects to use the funding to grow Fraîche’s footprint in New York and to grow its team of eight employees, particularly in sales and marketing. He is hiring two sales reps and plans to have 20 employees overall by the third quarter of 2022. Fraîche has already signed 10 locations since the summer with plans to deploy into 30 locations in the next nine months and then grow to 100 locations by the end of 2023. “It’s now a question of visibility,” Lizarazu said. “As long as our salespeople are talking to the right customers, we see the market is ready, and offices are really excited about what we are doing.” 9 proptech investors talk co-living, home offices and other pandemic trends  Are rivals snacking on Instacart’s core grocery delivery market?

2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/full-harvest-imperfect-produce-food-waste/","Full Harvest targets food waste by finding homes for imperfect, surplus produce","","Food waste is a $2.6 trillion problem globally as some 40% of food is wasted annually. Full Harvest believes this is a distribution problem that can be solved by digitizing the produce supply chain. The San Francisco-based company’s produce business-to-business marketplace provides a way for produce buyers and sellers to quickly close deals on surplus or imperfect crops in just a few clicks. It also creates an additional revenue stream for farmers. Founder and CEO Christine Moseley told TechCrunch that a majority of produce companies are still using pen, paper and fax machines to do business. “This is one of the most important industries, and we wanted to automate and bring the industry online to solve things that haven’t been solved before,” she added. “For example, there is a ton of paperwork involved in buying and selling, but by automating the onboarding process, that process that used to take weeks now take minutes.” Full Harvest wants to fix the big farm food waste problem at source  So Full Harvest got busy developing some technology that includes a spot marketplace with a matching algorithm and visibility so that buyers could see what suppliers had available. It also created a third-party audit and verification process to provide consistent specifications to reduce the average amount of rescued produce that is turned away. The industry average stands at 10%, while the company’s rejection average is 1% to 2%, Moseley said. Within the past two years, Full Harvest’s impact on keeping food out of landfills grew five times, prompting the company to seek additional capital to keep the momentum going. Today, the company announced $23 million in Series B funding. Telus Ventures led the round, with participation from new investors Rethink Impact, Citi Impact, Doon Capital, Stardust Equity and Portfolia Food & AgTech Fund, and existing investors, including Spark Capital, Cultivian Sandbox, Astia Fund and Radicle Growth. As part of the investment, Jay Crone, investment director at Telus, joined Full Harvest’s board of directors. It’s been a while since we checked in with Full Harvest. We profiled the company at the beginning of its journey in 2016 and then again in 2017 when it raised $2 million. The company raised an additional $8.5 million in Series A funding in 2018. Including additional funding, the company now has $34.5 million in total funding. The company works with big names in the food and beverage, processor and grower industries, like Danone North America, SVZ and Tanimura & Antle. Full Harvest’s business model is to take a percentage of every transaction made on its marketplace. Between 2020 and 2021, the company tripled its revenue as it provided transparency into the supply chain, Moseley said. Back in 2018, Full Harvest had about eight employees; that has now grown to 35. The company also expanded geographically, including Canada. With the new capital, Moseley intends to invest in technology development, triple the size of Full Harvest’s technology and product teams in 2022, continue to expand its footprint in North America and advance its data and market insights offerings, like produce availability, pricing, specifications, sustainable offerings, quality and forecasting support. Apeel bites into another $250M funding round, at a $2B valuation, to accelerate fresh food supply chains  Full Harvest is not alone in addressing food waste and raising venture-backed capital for their efforts. Just this year, we’ve seen announcements from companies like: While that list of companies is innovating technology in the produce space, Moseley considers Full Harvest unique in that its expertise is on the sustainable product side and it has proven itself as a leader in digitization of the produce supply chain, putting it ahead of the curve on both fronts. Up next, the company plans to secure partnerships around logistics technology to scale further and expand on the SKUs it is able to offer. “We saw significant increase in our technology and user experiences after finishing some automating processes that were previously offline for the industry,” she added. “We also expanded on our spot buy marketplace and hit a big milestone of 50 million pounds sold.” From farm to phone: A paradigm shift in grocery "

The Competition Commission of India said Amazon, which invested in Future Coupons in 2019, “suppress[ed] the actual scope and purpose of the combination” and failed to notify some of its commercial arrangements. Reliance Retail, India’s largest retail chain, said a year ago it had reached an agreement with Future Group to acquire the latter’s retail and wholesaler business, as well as its logistics and warehousing business, for $3.4 billion. (CCI has approved the deal between the nation’s two largest retail chains.) Things began to get complicated shortly afterwards. Amazon accused Future Group of violating its contract and approached the Singapore arbitrator to halt the deal between the Indian firms, saying it had the right for first investment in Future Group. The matter reached India’s Supreme Court, which in August ruled in favor of Amazon to stall the deal. The CCI, which originally approved the deal between Amazon and Future, began reviewing it again following a complaint from Future. “The conduct of Amazon in supressing relevant and material documents against the disclosure requirement under Item 8.8 of Form I is a contravention of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 45 of the Act,” said CCI in a 59-page order on Friday. [H/T Reuters journalist Aditya Kalra.] Amazon, which is required to pay the fine within 60 days, said in a statement that it was reviewing the order. “We are reviewing the order passed by the Competition Commission of India, and will decide on next steps in due course,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. The development comes days after Amazon warned the Indian antitrust body that revoking its 2019 deal with Future Group would send a negative signal to foreign investors and enable Reliance, the owner of India’s largest retail chain, to “further restrict competition.” Confederation of All India Traders, a lobby group that represents millions of retailers in the South Asian market, said CCI’s Friday order is “a landmark order and Amazon stands fully exposed for its mal-practices, and bunch of lies at all levels together with continued violation of laws and the rules.”"
2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/adalytics-tcf-research/","Adtech vendors still tracking EU users who deny consent via IAB’s TCF, study suggests","","New research examining what happens after Internet users in Europe land on an ad-supported website and express their “privacy choices” — using a flagship ad industry consent management platform which is supposed to allow them to control the types of ads they receive (i.e. non-tracking vs “personalized”) — has raised fresh questions over the IAB Europe’s self-styled Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF). The TCF is already in hot water with privacy regulators. Last month the IAB Europe announced that it’s expecting to be found in breach of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — and that the framework will also be found in breach. Although the IAB sought to suggest that a few tweaks will suffice to fix problems identified by the Belgian data protection authority (DPA). We’re still waiting for publication of the final decision of the Belgian authority. But its preliminary findings — last year — highlighted a litany of GDPR failures. IAB Europe says it’s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR  Despite all that, the IAB has continued to argue the TCF is working as intending for the close to 800 adtech vendors who are thought to participate in the system, loudly rejecting criticism of it. Its CEO, Townsend Feehan, for example, pooh-poohed criticism earlier this month — telling Engadget that “none of this [tracking] happens if the user says no”. However the new study throws doubt on the claim that if a user says ‘no’ to tracking/behavioral ads via the IAB’s TCF, the adtech industry respectfully falls into line. A key piece of this research examined how the adtech ecosystem responds to user signals that request only basic, i.e. non-tracking-based ads, to examine how ad vendors respond when users say no to “personalized” ads. Here the researchers found evidence to suggest that many adtech vendors continue to track and profile Internet users when they have explicitly said they don’t want tracking-based ads. While a number of earlier studies have found problems with how publishers in the EU have implemented cookie consents, such as tracking cookies being dropped prior to asking a site visitor for their permission, this new research, carried out by adtech researcher, Adalytics, aims to zero in on the TCF framework itself — by examining instances where ad-supported websites have faithfully reported users’ ad choices. Problematic data flows after that implicate the adtech industry itself — and the claims it makes for the TCF as a flagship compliance tool — because it suggests the framework fails to accurately reflect and actually respect users’ “privacy choices” once they are passed to ad “partners”. Listing a series of takeaways, Adalytics writes that the findings suggest: Although it’s important to note there are limits to what the researchers were able to observe via Chrome Developer Tools — given that any processing being done on adtech companies’ own servers isn’t verifiable by such external research. Understanding the full picture of what’s done with people’s data once the adtech ecosystem gets its hands on it is difficult. But that also cuts to the heart of surveillance-based advertising’s problem with complying with the GDPR — which also requires, accountability, transparency and security when processing people’s data, as well as a valid legal basis to do so. Even setting those major overarching problems aside, just the fact of tracking cookies being dropped and user data being passed around when a person has explicitly said it should not be looks, well, awkward for the IAB’s TCF. To study data activity at the adtech end of the framework, the researchers ran tests in a number of countries in the EU — visiting websites they manually verified had correctly configured the framework to send the user’s consent string, and selecting only basic ads; refusing personalized/tracking-based ads/profiling etc and also limited the choice of adtech processor to a single vendor. The testers also made sure to object to “legitimate interests” so that their consent preferences could not be bypassed in that way. Instead, they found — in most cases — data flows that looked very different vs the choices that had been expressed. The paper also details numerous instances of tracking cookies being set prior to the user’s consent choices even being signalled. (Although they say they excluded such examples from their analysis as they were specifically aiming to study what happens after a user has submitted their choices via the TCF.) UK privacy watchdog warns adtech the end of tracking is nigh  Examples cited in the study of adtech vendors appearing to override/ignore TCF signals denying tracking include a visitor with a Belgian IP address to a popular local news website, nieuwsblad.be — who provides consent to basic ads only, and only consents to ads from Google (so they’re explicitly rejecting “personalized” ads and profiling) — yet who, on checking Chrome Developer Tools for network HTTP requests, observes HTTPS requests sent to ib.adnxs.com, a domain owned by AppNexus (aka Xandr), which responds by dropping a cookie called “uuid2” set for three months. “Given that [this user] objected to personalised ads and creating a personalised profile, only provided consent to Google, and the fact that these consent choices were directly included in the HTTP request to adnxs.com, it is not clear why the AppNexus server responded by setting a persistent, advertising related cookie in [the user’s] browser,” the researchers observe. In another example, a user with a French IP address visits the news website lemonde.fr and once again — despite not consenting to any cookies or purposes offered in the consent banner — they see HTTPS request being sent to id5-sync.com, which responds by setting a cookie called “id5” for three months, and triggering a 302 HTTP redirect to sync data with rtb-csync.smartadserver.com.  “This specific HTTPS request that was sent to id5-sync.com contains the previously mentioned TCF string in a query string parameter called “gdpr_consent”,” the researchers report, adding that: “The domain id5-sync.com belongs to ID5, a London-based “identity platform for the digital advertising industry”.” They further note that the ID5 Universal ID is described in a github overview as a “shared, neutral identifier that publishers, advertisers, and ad tech platforms can use to recognise users”. So, again, if the user is saying they don’t want to be identified and tracked for ads, why is the id5 cookie being dropped at all? In another example detailed in the study, also involving a French IP address — this time the user visits the newspaper latribune.fr — the user’s consent choices are again apparently tossed in the virtual trash.  In this instance the user had specified they wanted basic ads served by US supply side platform OpenX.  However Openx.net was observed triggering user ID syncs with “numerous other parties”, including Amazon, Google, DataXu, AppNexus, Beeswax (bidr.io), Adelphic Predictive Data platform (ipredictive.com), AdPilot (erne.co), Simplifi Holdings (simpli.fi), and others, per the study.  In another example — involving a French IP user visiting atlantico.fr; and consenting to basic ads from Google only — the user sees a “lot of HTTPS requests being made with this TCF consent string, some of which appear to be user data syncing or setting tracking cookies”.  The researchers go on to note that: “A request sent to s.cpx.to responses by setting a cookie for 1-year called “cpSess”. This domain is owned by London-based Captify, and the “cpSess” cookie appears to be used to store and link personal information about the user” — before citing another source that suggests this cookie is “used as a tracking mechanism for […] advertising companies” and “helps with the delivery of targeted marketing adverts whilst users browse”. The study details numerous other examples of unexpected data flows and syncing being observed after the user has asked not to be tracked. The researchers also detail results of large-scale automated tests, as well as the manual examples cited above — based on crawler data from 48,698 different publisher domains — and here they found evidence of “tens of thousands” of ad requests erroneously claiming the GDPR does not apply to web users who were actually in the EU… Out of 35,389 publishers found to have an HTTPS request that was sent to an ad tech vendor and contained either the ‘gdpr=0’ query string parameter, or the ‘gdpr=1’ query string parameter, 28,941 (81.8%) contained at least one HTTPS request sent to an ad tech vendor, wherein the query string macro parameter “gdpr=” was set to “0” — meaning they were signalling the GDPR does not apply. More from Adalytics’ write up: “According to the IAB TCF documentation and to Google’s documentation, “1 indicates that GDPR applies and 0 indicates that it does not.” Many ad tech vendors were observed processing the German and Finnish user data when “gdpr=0”, despite the crawler not having clicked on the CMP consent banner. In each of these cases, the ad tech vendor could have validated that the user was in fact in the EU by performing a simple IP address geolocation lookup. However, it appears that many take this “gdpr=0” parameter at face value, without performing any additional server-side checks, prior to sending tracking cookies or performing user data syncs.” To try to verify this finding, Adalytics says it reached out to a programmatic media buyer who was targeting ads to users across the EU, UK, and Switzerland. This buyer had their ads served a total of 111 million times — while the “gdpr_applies” macro was set to “0” 42.3% of the time — “indicating that the ad tech company involved was claiming that the GDPR does not apply to these users”.  Yet on checking where those 47M ads were served, by using an IP address geo-location lookup service, Adalytics reports that the advertiser found the majority were served to users based in Spain, Croatia, Italy, France, and other EU countries, meaning the GDPR does actually apply…   “If ad tech companies are not checking the integrity of the “gdpr_applies” strings by performing IP address geolocation checks, they may end up misleading their advertiser clients about the relevant regulations that apply to their advertising campaigns,” Adalytics goes on to warn. The findings further highlight the scale of the problem of ad fraud — and, where the IAB Europe’s TCF framework is concerned, suggest it offers merely a veneer of legal compliance because it isn’t actually capable of doing what’s claimed on the tin. All-too-often adtech vendors have not properly implemented and deployed it, per the research findings — making the “Transparency and Consent Framework” at best, a sham; or, well, compliance theatre.  Little wonder this whole system is in regulatory hot water — although the length of time it’s taken EU watchdogs to interrogate the reality underlying the adtech industry’s claims continues to be extremely troubling for anyone who cares about democratic oversight and fundamental rights. Privacy experts slam UK’s ‘disastrous’ failure to tackle unlawful adtech  “The conclusion that we make in our study is that the adtech vendors have not taken the time, money and engineering labor hours to properly configure their servers and APIs,” Adalytics’ founder Krzysztof Franaszek told TechCrunch, discussing the research. “In theory, all TCF participants… should have set up their servers and APIs in a way that checks and validates the TCF strings. “If an API receives some user data, to which the TCF string shows the user has not consented, the vendor should immediately discard and avoid doing anything with that data.” Franaszek noted that the researchers did observe at least one example of correct behavior — an instance where AppNexus received a TCF string that did not allow personalization, or for a vendor called Index Exchange to get the data, and “properly/rightfully configured their server to respond with an HTTP 400 error code, that says ‘Request failed due to privacy signals'”. However he pointed out that that’s what “ALL 795 TCF companies should be doing”, and the study shows — on the contrary — many companies are simply not checking the strings. Also commenting on the findings, Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties — and a long time adtech whistleblower who has filed numerous complaints over real-time-bidding’s (RTB) abuse of personal data — said the study is just the latest illustration that “the TCF was just a bad idea”. “There is no control. No technical measure to actually control what happens to the data,” Ryan told TechCrunch. “This means the TCF can never fulfil its purported objectives of providing control and transparency. “The central argument we made to the Belgian APD [DPA] is that the TCF’s inevitable failure, due to the inherent and known insecurity of RTB, means that in addition to being an unnecessary nuisance in the lives of all Europeans, the TCF also infringes the data minimization principle [of GDPR] because it processes TCF string personal data for a purpose that is impossible to achieve.” Ryan also pointed back to some 2017 IAB correspondence — which came to light back in 2019 via FOI — in which Feehan, who was at the time seeking to lobby the European Commission on ePrivacy rules, implies consent is incompatible with RTB — attaching a paper to her email to EU lawmakers with the observation that “it is technically impossible for the user to have prior information about every data controller involved in a real-time bidding (RTB) scenario”. And for consent to be valid under GDPR it must be specific, informed, and — indeed — freely given. There are some limitations to the Adalytics study — such as the manual component being limited to a small number of publishers that “appear to correctly encode user consent input, in order to rule out the possibility that a publisher’s or CMP’s errors were resulting in user profiling occurring without a user’s consent”, as Franaszek puts it. It is also not clear how many/what proportion of the 795 adtech companies using the TCF system aren’t properly respecting user choices. The instance cited above where a user denial of consent was correctly responded to shows it can happen. How often it does is a whole other matter, though. In any case, those vendors observed by the researchers apparently not respecting users’ denial of tracking included “several multi-billion dollar multinationals like Rubicon, Pubmatic, Amazon, Google and Trade Desk”, per Franaszek. “I think if you look at the stock market capitalization of the vendors that we examined, it’s far greater than 50% of the total digital advertising industry,” he added. A more general caveat is that, given the adtech industry’s highly opaque character, it’s always difficult to understand how data is or isn’t being processed — and the researchers acknowledge that a lot of “nuance” is required to interpret the data in a section of the paper discussing limitations.   The study has also not gone through formal peer review so has not been subject to the rigorous academic process required if it had been published in a peer reviewed journal. But, well, the findings sure don’t look good for adtech. Per public documentation on a github repository for v1.0 of the IAB’s TCF framework, the ad industry body suggested that their — at that time — incoming “technical industry solution” would allow website operators to: The question that naturally follows from those stated capabilities is well, what then? What happens after users’ ‘privacy choices’ are signalled to the data-gobbling adtech ecosystem? How does the TCF actually ensure ad vendors respect people’s choices? Adalytics’ research is just the latest study to suggest that industry standard pop-up “privacy choices” are a mirage; a suggestive illusion of choice wrapped in a pantomime of consent in a bid to square the impossible circle for surveillance ads: GDPR compliance. Because it seems the only way to be sure the “choice” that you ask the TCF to pass on to adtech vendors will get respected is if you ask for the tracking to continue… The IAB has been contacted for comment on Adalytics’ research, and also with questions regarding whether it takes any steps to verify that participating ad vendors are complying with TCF strings expressing user choices. We have also asked the IAB how it expects to adapt the framework — and its own activities — in order to come into compliance with GDPR, in light of the Belgian finding of a breach. We’ll update this report with any response. But if the CMPs and the IAB EU are reinterpreted as data controllers they are–in theory–given the additional responsibility of ""the purposes and means of the processing of personal data"" which would make them responsible for consent fraud and user data transmission… — Aram Zucker-Scharff (@Chronotope) November 5, 2021  Update: The IAB Europe has now responded — sending this statement re: Adalytics’ research: “When implemented correctly, the TCF allows internet users to communicate to websites and their vendors that they do not wish to have their data collected or processed. All vendors that are TCF participants are expected to comply with their commitments under the TCF, including not processing any data when the user has rejected or objected to it. “TCF is mainly a policy and technical standard that companies can implement in their commercial relationships, but using the TCF does not alleviate any vendor from their responsibility to fully comply with the GDPR. While it is the responsibility of the vendor to make sure they are applying the TCF appropriately, IAB Europe provides support to make sure the TCF is implemented correctly and addresses non-compliance. “In September, we launched a TCF Vendor compliance programme that enables us to monitor Vendor compliance and enforce non-compliance. This includes enforcing against the setting of non-essential cookies without users’ consent or the processing of users’ personal data without legal basis, verifying the duration of cookies used by vendors and ensuring users’ choices are forwarded faithfully.” Regarding the Belgian DPA’s probe of the TCF, it said it cannot comment further “on an ongoing investigation”. “We will work with the relevant authorities to address any issues raised with the TCF once the ruling is finalised,” the IAB added.

2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/no-code-data-pipeline-platform-hevo-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/","No-code data pipeline platform Hevo raises $30 million led by Sequoia Capital India","","Hevo Data, a SaaS startup that is helping firms collate troves of data they generate and accumulate to make better use of them, has raised $30 million in a new financing round following a strong year of growth. Sequoia Capital India led the San Francisco and Bangalore-headquartered startup’s $30 million Series B round. A number of investors, including Qualgro, Lachy Groom and Chiratae Ventures, also participated in the round, which pushes the five-year-old startup’s all-time funding to $43 million. Firms, with so many divisions such as marketing, engineering and design, engage with numerous services and platforms for their business. But the data they generate and rely on sits in silos within those divisions, making it difficult for the firm as a whole to gain real-time visibility into it and take actionable decisions. Hevo Data has built a data pipeline platform to make it exceedingly easy for firms to integrate and fetch data from different sources to one dashboard as well as to supply it to popular cloud data-warehouses such as Snowflake, Google BigQuery and Amazon Redshift, explained Manish Jethani, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, in an interview with TechCrunch. “Different parts of the company use different types of software for their work. But if the data doesn’t flow across different departments, nobody will have full visibility into what all that is happening,” he said, drawing parallels with the flow of blood in a human body. “So as a business, if I have invested thousands of dollars in marketing, I would want to know how many users came and bought — or not purchase — from the platform and how many times they made the purchase. How much money did I end up making per order? This would help me inform how I should be tweaking my marketing spends,” he said. “For this, I have to combine my marketing, orders data, finance data and customer support data,” he said. It’s a challenge that Jethani grappled with in his previous startup, called SpoonJoy, which he sold to Grofers. After moving to Grofers, a much bigger startup, Jethani said he realized that even larger firms face this challenge. (He said that companies as large as Amazon and Flipkart tend to build their own workflows and have large workforces to tackle this.) The startup’s offering combines data from multiple disparate sources and applications, including sales CRM, advertising channels, marketing tech, financial system software and customer support products to build a 360-degree view of their business and customers, said Jethani.  Some popular integrations offered by Hevo. One of the additional value prepositions of Hevo is that it’s a no-code platform. Individuals are not spending much time — or require any technical understanding in — establishing the integrations to get the data to flow to a central hub, he said. (The accessibility is as simple as setting up an action on IFTTT, for instance.) Hevo features more than 100 pre-built integrations across databases, SaaS applications, cloud storage, SDKs and streaming services. The startup said it has amassed over 1,000 customers across multiple categories in more than 40 countries and will deploy the fresh funds to develop new products as it moves to tap a bigger slice of the market. The startup said it grew by a whopping 500% in the past year. One of the new offerings it is working on is an insight platform that will enable users to do analysis with the data they are collating. Another product in the works is called “Reverse ETL,” which will aim to help customers use their data beyond just the analytics use case, he said. “Data has become one of the most important business inputs in the last decade. Hevo Data is building foundational infrastructure to enable bi-directional mobility of data,” said Tejeshwi Sharma, MD at Sequoia India, in a statement. “The more mobile data becomes within organizations, the more useful it shall be. We are impressed by the product DNA of the company — the secret behind the widely loved product combines the duality of technical sophistication and consumer grade experience. Sequoia Capital India is delighted to double down on the partnership with Hevo and lead the Series B round.”"
2021-12-17,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/mobile-overdraft-facility-fuliza-outshines-silicon-valley-backed-lending-apps-in-kenya/","Mobile overdraft facility Fuliza outshines Silicon Valley-backed lending apps in Kenya","Debt crisis","A digital mobile overdraft facility christened Fuliza by Kenya’s biggest telco Safaricom Plc is giving the country’s popular loan apps a run for their money barely three years after its launch. Fuliza allows Safaricom customers to access unsecured credit by overdrawing on M-Pesa — the telecommunication company mobile money wallet that allows its users to pay bills and send, receive and withdraw money through their phones. The uptake of Fuliza is currently at 18.3% across the country while that of loan apps decreased by 6.2 percentage points to 2.1% in the last two years, a study by the country’s monetary authority Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in collaboration with Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD) Kenya shows. The latest bi-annual FinAccess Household Survey report said digital loan apps experienced the largest decline in usage when compared to other financial products and services by credit unions, banks and microfinance institutions. “This may be explained by competition from formal digital credit products like Fuliza, (and) unfair debt collection practices by the digital loan apps,” said the report. The report also said that a directive by the CBK, barring unlicensed digital lenders from sharing the personal details of loan defaulters with credit reference bureaus (CRBs), may have deterred the apps from lending to customers viewed as risky. Additionally, the uncertainty around the regulation of the apps by the CBK during the COVID-19 peak may have prevented them from extending credit to new borrowers. A bill on the regulation of digital lenders was tabled before Kenya’s legislative assembly and was just this month signed into a law. The Digital Lenders Association of Kenya, which represents about 25 digital lenders out of the more than 100 operating in Kenya, told TechCrunch in a past interview that its members generally give out loans worth $40 million every month, an amount that was, however, halved during COVID. Fuliza, which is formally registered and licensed, operates in partnership with two local banks — KCB and NCBA. The product seems to have filled the mobile lending void obstructed by regulation, and has now stepped-up competition for mobile loan apps like the Silicon Valley-backed Branch, which launched in Kenya in 2015, and the PayPal-supported Tala, which set up operations in the country in 2014 — one of the first digital lenders to enter the East African country. According to a Safaricom report, the telco extended $3.1 billion in Fuliza credit during the 2020/21 financial year, a 43% increase from the previous year. This translates to an estimated $12 million credit that Fuliza extends to Kenyans every day. Safaricom has 23.8 million M-Pesa customers. The genesis of mobile lending in Kenya can be traced back to 2012, when Safaricom launched M-Shwari, a mobile-based savings and loans product, that is still running in partnership with NCBA Bank. Since then, Kenya has experienced a flurry of digital and micro-lending apps, amounting to hundreds. Loan apps and facilities such as Fuliza offer instant collateral-free credit, overshadowing loans by conventional banking facilities, which go through lengthy approval processes, while mostly requiring extensive collateral. These fintech innovations may also be one of the reasons Kenya’s formal financial inclusion is at 83.7% in 2021 from 26.7% in 2006. However, while the lending apps have provided credit relief to people left out by the formal banking sector, they have operated in an unregulated environment for years until a fortnight ago when the president signed a new law giving CBK the authority to license and oversee their operations. The lack of regulation has left gaps for predatory pricing, with some of the apps charging annualized interest rates exceeding 800%, leaving many borrowers impoverished. The FinAccess report states that half (50.9%) of the surveyed respondents had failed to repay loans sourced from the lending apps. “The top three credit providers where a majority of respondents reported to have defaulted on a credit facility are; mobile banking loan (including Fuliza), digital apps loan and loan from family/friend/neighbor,” said the report. Among the leading concerns for borrowers was the high cost of accessing and maintaining the loans due to the exorbitant interest rates by the mobile lenders. Unexpected charges, mostly imposed after repayment default and a lack of transparency in pricing and other charges beforehand were also cited as worrisome issues. To fix the problem of hidden charges,the country’s competition authority communicated that it will from June next year require all digital lenders to disclose their full fees and penalties every four months. Besides, with the newly passed law, lenders are compelled to apply for licenses from the CBK, as compared to previously, when they only had to register to set up operations. They are also instructed to observe customer confidentiality and not share data with third parties — usually debt collectors. The latter requirement, especially, shields borrowers from rogue digital lenders that use debt shaming tactics when collecting monies owed to them by borrowers. Non-compliance will lead to the revocation of licenses."

The round was led by byFounders with participation from Flash Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Ascension and a group of angel investors, including Index Ventures’ venture partner Stephane Kurgan and Amplo VC founder and CEO Sheel Tyle. The latest round gives the company $5.2 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2020 by Henrik Lysgaard Jensen and Alex Boyce. As part of the investment, byFounders investor Sara Rywe and Flash Ventures partner Lorenzo Franzi have joined the company’s board. CEO Lysgaard Jensen and COO Boyce met each other about two years ago and bonded over helping small businesses digitize. Targeting small business owners, like plumbers, electricians and mechanics, Lysgaard Jensen believes local businesses “are the backbone of every community,” but many of the tools developed for business management are either out of reach to businesses like this nor designed with them in mind. Other startups are also calling attention to these types of businesses. In November, Puls Technologies raised $15 million for its mobile app connecting tradespeople with on-demand home repair services. There are also larger companies in the space, like Jobber, which announced $60 million in funding at the beginning of the year. This area is also particularly personal for Boyce, who explained that his mother is a small business owner who ran much of her business out of a leather-bound notebook, always fearing that it might get lost. “These are topics we are working through,” he told TechCrunch. “We thought about how we could become agents of change during the pandemic, which was a wake-up call as we saw shifting consumer demands, people wanting to get more technology-centric and engage with local merchants in different ways.” As such, the company’s tools digitize for small businesses what was traditionally done manually and on paper, like invoices. It brings together communications, payments, marketing and calendars into one dashboard to manage their businesses and amp up their online profiles. Users are able to communicate with their customers through a variety of methods, from messaging to social media, while also generating invoices for instant payment and insights into lead generation. Fuzey also offers document templates and one-click customer reviews to make the process of leaving a review easier. “Response time is important, and we even have response templates with predefined questions or comments so you can get back to customers quickly,” Lysgaard Jensen said. “We are big believers in the 20, 30, 40-time impact of this.” The company, which went live with its product in June, will utilize the new funding on product development and geographical expansion. It is already operating in select markets in Europe, the U.S. and Canada. Fuzey has 10 employees right now and is seeing double-digit growth month over month in both customers and revenue.

Its strategy is multi-thronged. The giant’s house-developed AliExpress has found success in Russia in recent years. In 2016, it bought Lazada, which came out of the Rocket Internet empire, and has helped the Southeast Asia-focused marketplace compete. Lazada grew 80% to hit 130 million annual active consumers in the 18 months ended September, according to a presentation at Alibaba’s investor day on Thursday. Its monthly active users as of September were 159 million — larger than its AAC likely because not every user on Lazada ends up purchasing things. Like its Chinese sister app Taobao, Lazada has introduced entertainment features like livestreaming and games that try to lock users in, making it more than a pure shopping app. Lazada wrapped up 2021 with $21 billion in gross merchandise value, the amount of sales before expenses are deducted. And 922,000 sellers, many of whom are from China, were active monthly on the marketplace as of September, more than doubling the pool size from a year ago. Alibaba is hardly the only Chinese tech titan wrestling for a slice of Southeast Asia’s flourishing digital economy. Its nemesis Tencent is one of the main investors in Sea Group, which operates Lazada’s rival platform Shopee. In 2020, Sea logged $35.4 billion in GMV.

2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tiger-global-backs-fintech-creditbook-in-first-pakistan-investment/","Tiger Global backs fintech CreditBook in first Pakistan investment","","Two years ago, a group of entrepreneurs in Pakistan began surveying the market to understand why financial services weren’t reaching the majority of merchants in the world’s fifth most populous nation. On Friday, Tiger Global said it is backing their startup, CreditBook, to help address those challenges. This is the New York-headquartered firm’s first investment in Pakistan. A number of other investors, including Better Tomorrow Ventures, Firstminute Capital, Banana Capital, VentureSouq, Ratio Ventures and i2i Ventures, as well as angel investors Sriram Krishnan and Julian Shapiro also participated in the $11 million pre-Series A round. This is also Firstminute Capital’s first investment in the South Asian market. “We started the research and began experimentation in late 2019,” said Iman Jamall, co-founder of CreditBook, in an interview with TechCrunch. “I was working as a service designer on a project for one of the largest Pakistani banks at the time and was observing different persona types to understand why financial services hadn’t made inroads in the country.” The challenges that Jamall, one of the few female founders in the country, identified were cash flow, the role of credit and the social relationships around it and the overreliance on “paper for everything essentially,” she said.  Images Credits: CreditBook The overreliance on paper to maintain ledgers and the always-running low cash flow is a challenge that merchants in many markets in South Asia and Southeast Asia share. As we previously covered, often these small businesses run on informal credit and rely on money they secure from selling their existing inventory to buy their next batch. The customers buy things for weeks and sometimes months before they clear the tab. These shortcomings are hurting these small businesses and mom and pop stores and impeding their growth at a time when large e-commerce giants are attempting to court customers. CreditBook today offers a bookkeeping app to merchants, enabling them to digitize the handwritten ledger that they have traditionally used to keep track of daily accounts. The eponymous mobile app has amassed merchants in more than 400 towns and cities, the startup said. CreditBook declined to reveal the number of merchants who are using the service, but said that the number of transacting users has increased by 10 times since last year. Digital bookkeeping is the startup’s marquee offering today, but Jamall said CreditBook is working on building and testing financial products on top of it. It’s too early to unveil precisely what those financial products would look like, she said. (But it’s definitely not e-commerce, she said.) Jamall offered some context around the areas CreditBook is exploring. “In Pakistan, there is a huge whitespace in payments. But mobile money has started to gain traction, especially amid the pandemic,” she said, adding that the local regulator has also made a push in recent years to accelerate the adoption of mobile payments and is focusing on building an instant payments infrastructure. (Similar to India’s UPI, which in recent years has become the most popular way users transact online.) It’s a massive opportunity. CreditBook estimates that there’s a $45 billion unmet financing gap for small businesses. Pakistan is home to more than 220 million people, 60% of whom are under the age of 30. “We are excited to partner with CreditBook and make Tiger Global’s first investment into Pakistan,” said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. “The investment is a testament to the incredible traction and vision demonstrated by the team.” Friday’s announcement builds on what has been a watershed year for Pakistan’s fast-growing startup ecosystem as several global investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Addition, 20VC and Buckley Ventures make their first bets in the country. Startups in Pakistan have raised over $300 million this year, more than previous six years combined. Grocery delivery startup Krave Mart announced earlier this week it had raised $6 million in its pre-seed funding round."

After a crowdsourcing effort, the cable is now available to buy starting at $59 and has an accompanying app that works on macOS, Windows and Linux, allowing the person using the cable to easily arm and disarm the cable with a touch of a button. “Most people aren’t handling top-secret documents from whistleblowers and worried about the secret police knocking down their doors, but that’s the level of risk that I designed BusKill for,” the project’s creator Michael Altfield told TechCrunch. “And I wanted it to be accessible to journalists who don’t necessarily use Linux and don’t know how to use the CLI [command line interface].” BusKill is designed to lock your computer when it’s physically separated from you, but Linux users can further configure the app to trigger a self-destruct command, which scrambles the device’s cryptographic keys, rendering the computer’s data inaccessible in just a few seconds. The project also plans to release triggers that shut down a computer when the magnetic cable is severed.

Now, on TikTok’s brand new Discord, you can chat with strangers about… whatever you’d want to talk to a bunch of TikTokers about. Maybe the best way to make Emily Mariko’s viral salmon recipe? @discord will you be my home away from home <U+0001F64F>  <U+266C> Zodiac – Will Gittens    “This server’s just like your for you feed: it’s made for you, some of its comments are spicy, and your parents have no idea what it is,” TikTok wrote in the Discord’s welcome channel. Some of the rules on the Discord include no NSFW content and no buying crypto. Before chatting, you have to indicate by selecting a check-mark reaction that you read the rules — this is common in popular Discords to discourage spam. There’s even an option to indicate your gender pronouns on your server profile. As of publication, there are only 400 people in the Discord, which TikTok told TechCrunch is a “soft launch.” There are five moderators from TikTok, which could pose a problem if the server continues to grow. As one user said, “let’s take the advantage [to talk to each other] when there are not 300,000 people trying to chat at the same time.” To prevent spam (which is also against the rules), TikTok is using “slowmode,” a Discord feature that only lets people send a message every 30 seconds. But users quickly got around the slowmode by making threads, where the time limit between messages doesn’t apply. Soon after, moderators removed the ability to make threads. i stan @discord pic.twitter.com/LfkjKsagXR — TikTok (@tiktok_us) December 15, 2021  Right now, the conversation channels on the TikTok Discord are relatively ordinary, expect for some light trolling. There are chats for introducing yourself, sharing your TikToks, TikTok support, server feedback, TikTok sounds and more. There’s even a “game room,” indicating TikTok’s growing interest in gaming — right now, the platform is testing a desktop streaming software called TikTok Live Studio."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/longtime-gm-exec-dan-ammann-is-out-as-cruise-ceo/","Longtime GM exec Dan Ammann is out as Cruise CEO","","Cruise CEO Dan Ammann is leaving the company, its parent company General Motors said in a late afternoon statement. Kyle Vogt, who co-founded the autonomous vehicle company, and was the company’s first CEO, will take over the role on an interim basis. Vogt has been serving as Cruise’s president and CTO. Wesley Bush, the former chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman and a GM board member, will join the Cruise board, GM said. GM and Cruise did not provide additional details about why Ammann was leaving. The departure of the longtime GM executive is unexpected and came as a surprise to Cruise employees who asked not to be identified. The news was shared with Cruise employees Thursday as it was shared with the public, with one person noting it seemed unplanned and chaotic. One anecdote that illustrates the lack of planning around Ammann’s departure was staff waited for more than 10 minutes to hear from GM chairman and CEO Mary Barra who was unable to join a virtual town hall meeting meant to explain the change. Vogt ended up having to put her on speakerphone from his smartphone so she could communicate with Cruise staff. Ammann was at the center of GM’s initial investment and acquisition of Cruise. He oversaw GM’s relationship with Cruise. And he was the person with whom Vogt had regular contact. Vogt even mentioned his connection to Ammann while onstage at SF Disrupt in September 2018. Ammann also came to the job with a specific skill set. When Ammann first joined GM in 2010 as vice president of finance and treasurer, his first task was to manage GM’s initial public offering. At the time, Ammann’s appointment as Cruise CEO seemed to signal that an IPO could be a goal. Ammann was tapped to be CEO of Cruise in late 2018. He took over officially in January 2019. At the time, the move seemed to make sense. Cruise had grown from a small startup with 40 employees to more than 1,000 by the time Ammann took over. And while Ammann continued to push the company to expand, there were missed targets, notably the plan to launch a commercial robotaxi business in 2019. The company has spent the past two years inching toward that commercialization goal, along with the rest of the industry, which has gone through a spate of consolidation. GM outlined a bullish autonomous vehicle plan at its October investor day and its branded “Under the Hood” event the following month. Those ambitions included comments from Ammann, who laid out the company’s plan to launch a commercial robotaxi and delivery service starting with retrofitted Chevy Bolts and eventually scaling to an army of tens of thousands of purpose-built Origin AVs on the road over the next few years. Separately, Cruise’s go-to-market VP Lucas Watson left the company last week, according to several sources with direct knowledge. While his departure is apparently unrelated, it does raise questions about the business side of Cruise, aspects of which Ammann and Watson would have been focused on."

The streaming service is giving subscribers the option to learn more about their viewing habits through a new “Your TV DNA” tool. The tool is accessible on a newly launched website where users can access a profile of their personalized viewing habits throughout the year. The tool analyzes users’ streaming habits and shares information about things like their most-watched genres and how many films and TV show episodes they watched. To get started, subscribers need to log into their Hulu accounts on the website in order to receive their recap. From there, the tool will analyze the user’s data and then display their most-watched genres, which can include categories like edgy comedies, high-stakes dramas, crime dramas and more. The recap will also include a “streaming persona” that’s meant to represent the user’s viewing habits of the year. The tool also aims to help users discover recommendations about what they should watch next on the streaming service. The recommendations include upcoming or current content that is similar to what the user has already watched. Users also have the option to share their recap with others on social media. “This year, for the first time, Hulu is giving subscribers the opportunity to request to see their own viewing DNA and the tools to proudly share, should they so choose, their streaming persona,” the company said in a blog post regarding the announcement. “Starting today, subscribers can visit YourTVDNA.com and request to see their personalized Hulu viewing habits throughout 2021.”  Image Credits: Hulu The launch of the new feature comes as shareable end-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify’s annual Wrapped experience that is widely shared across social media each year. Given its success, it’s no surprise that other companies are mimicking the popular features. Hulu joins many other digital giants that have released their own Wrapped-like features. Last week, Facebook and Instagram introduced personalized “Year in Review” features to give users a way to reflect on the past year. Reddit also rolled out personalized recaps with stats about users’ habits last week; meanwhile, Snapchat launched its “Year End Story” this week. In addition to the personalized recaps, Hulu also released information about overall trends on its platform. The company revealed that “Only Murders in the Building” was its most-watched comedy series and that “Nine Perfect Strangers” set a new record as its most-watched series ever. Hulu also notes that adult animation was the No. 1 genre on the streaming service based on hours watched. The company also outlined that the most streamed day of 2021 was Sunday, January 31, largely because subscribers tuned into the previous evening’s “Saturday Night Live” episode hosted by John Krasinski. In terms of non-original series, the most-watched medical drama was “The Good Doctor,” which also topped this category in 2020. Other popular non-Original series included “Law & Order: SVU” and “Modern Family.”"

The company, which made the announcement Thursday as part of its first earnings report, said the funds will be used to expand production capacity of its Normal, Illinois factory from 150,000 to 200,000 electric vehicles a year. Its second factory will be built east of Atlanta in Morgan and Walton counties and will have a targeted annual production capacity of 400,000 vehicles a year. This Georgia factory will include a co-located battery cell production facility. Construction will begin in summer 2022 with production beginning in 2024. The company said in its shareholder letter that it picked the site due to the combination of sustainable business operations, talent pool, and proximity to supply chain and logistics. “As we look ahead, our Georgia facility will be critically important to our objective to accelerate the large-scale adoption of sustainable transportation,” the letter said, adding that the facility will be used for our next generation of vehicles. In the near-term, that capital will also be used to design and develop its next generation of vehicles. To date, Rivian has three vehicles: the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which are aimed at consumers, and its commercial van. Amazon, which holds more than 20% of Rivian stock, is the company’s first commercial van customer with an initial 100,000 vehicle order. Rivian will also invest heavily in vertical integration, which follows the company and its founder and CEO RJ Scaringe’s strategy over the past several years. Specifically, Rivian intends to invest in battery technology across the value chain, including battery cell chemistry development, raw material sourcing and in-house cell manufacturing, the company said in its shareholder letter. A look at one graphic in its shareholder letter illustrates those vertical integration ambitions.  Image Credits: Screenshot/Rivian The electric drive system will be another investment priority, according to the shareholder letter. The aim, the company said, is to advance its “in-house family of future drive units offering higher performance, improved packaging, and lower cost.” Generating sales is of course at the top of the to-do list, which Rivian plans to increase by continuing to invest in customer engagement and experiences, including its “experience spaces,” the Rivian membership program for consumers and its digital fleet management software that is branded FleetOS for its commercial customers. Rivian outlined plans to build out its vehicle service and charging infrastructure. By the end of the year, Rivian said it will have more than 60 mobile service vans in service and eight service centers located in California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, Utah and Washington."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/internet-association-shuts-down/","The most prominent group lobbying for Silicon Valley’s interests in DC just fell apart","","The trade group representing Silicon Valley’s biggest companies will disband, even as tech enters a new era of intense regulatory scrutiny in the nation’s capital. The Internet Association has fought for tech’s interests in Washington for the last nine years, lobbying lawmakers to advance the combined interests of Facebook, Amazon, Google, Airbnb, Uber, Twitter, eBay, Spotify, Zillow and many more of the most recognizable names in tech, from the largest companies on down. Politico first reported that the group would close up shop. “Our industry has undergone tremendous growth and change since the Internet Association was formed almost 10 years ago, and in line with this evolution, the Board has made the difficult decision to close the organization at the end of this year,” the group wrote in a published statement. “… IA has made great progress on its mission to foster innovation, promote economic growth, and empower people through a free and open internet.” In recent years, some of the Internet Association’s members have come into direct conflict on policy issues. That rift appears to be widening on defining topics, even among the group’s biggest members. While the IA’s stated position defends keeping Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act intact as it stands now, IA member Meta (now parent company of Facebook) recently told lawmakers that it’s open to changing the law in order to “earn some of our Section 230 protections.” The group represents its members on issues like AI, broadband, content moderation and privacy, but conspicuously stayed out of the antitrust debate — the most relevant, consequential policy conversation in the industry’s recent history. With lawmakers gearing up to impose new regulations on tech companies, antitrust will continue to eclipse most other policy concerns that affect both major players in tech and the smaller companies that point to concerns around their market dominance. Yelp, which joined the Internet Association in 2014, left previously due to differences with the group. “This org could’ve saved itself years ago by kicking out everyone with a market cap greater than $500b (ie GAFA),: Yelp Senior Public Policy VP Luther Lowe tweeted. “I made this suggestion to the leadership a few years ago, but it was shot down, so we quit.” Yelp has testified before Congress on antitrust issues, arguing that Google, previously a fellow IA member, is a monopoly that unfairly gives search preference to its own products. Last year, longtime IA president Michael Beckerman left to join TikTok as the company’s head of public policy in the Americas. Microsoft and Uber both left the group last month, signaling IA’s waning usefulness in the current tech policy landscape.

2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/cytrox-predator-phone-hacking-meta/","A new spyware-for-hire, Predator, caught hacking phones of politicians and journalists","Cytrox is one of seven surveillance companies now banned from Meta's platforms","While NSO Group was taking flak for hacking into the phones of journalists, activists and human rights defenders, an entire class of spyware makers and surveillance-for-hire outfits were operating as normal, largely unnoticed. These private surveillance groups develop and deploy never-before-seen exploits that quietly hack into and steal the contents of a victim’s phone — call logs, text messages, emails, location data and more — often on behalf of authoritarian governments targeting their most vocal critics. Now, following an investigation by researchers at Citizen Lab and Facebook’s new parent company, Meta, seven surveillance-for-hire groups have been banned from using the social media giant’s platforms to target other users. Meta said Thursday that it has removed more than 1,500 Facebook and Instagram accounts associated with the seven outfits, which the company said were used for reconnaissance, social engineering and sending malicious links to thousands of victims in over 100 countries. Meta said it’s notified around 50,000 people it believes were targeted by the seven groups. Although much of the recent focus of the surveillance industry has been on companies like NSO Group, both Citizen Lab and Meta warned that the wider surveillance-for-hire industry will continue to balloon if left unregulated. “It’s important to realize that NSO is only one piece of a much broader global cyber mercenary ecosystem,” according to a report of Meta’s investigation seen by TechCrunch before its publication. One of the banned companies is Cytrox, a North Macedonia-based spyware maker. Meta said it found the company using a “vast” infrastructure of web domains mimicking legitimate news sites to target the iPhone and Android devices of its victims. Meta said it sent legal notices to Cytrox and blocked hundreds of domains associated with its infrastructure. Meta was acting on findings by Citizen Lab, which also on Thursday released a forensic report into the hacking of phones belonging to two Egyptians living in exile — a former politician and the host of a popular news show who asked not to be named. Citizen Lab said the spyware that infected their phones in July 2021, dubbed Predator, was developed by Cytrox. Citizen Lab first discovered the spyware on the iPhone belonging to Ayman Nour, an Egyptian politician and outspoken critic of the incumbent president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who took over the country following a military coup in 2013. Nour, who lives in exile in Turkey, became suspicious when his phone was “running hot.” Citizen Lab found that Nour’s phone had been infected with Pegasus, the now-infamous spyware created by NSO Group. That led to the discovery that his phone had been concurrently hit by the newly discovered Predator spyware. Both Nour’s phone and the phone belonging to the host of the news show were running iOS 14.6, the latest version of iOS at the time of the hacks, suggesting the spyware made use of a never-before-seen exploit in the iPhone’s software to infect the phones. Apple spokesperson Scott Radcliffe declined to say whether the company had fixed the vulnerability. 	 Predator shares a similar set of features to NSO’s Pegasus. Citizen Lab said Nour was sent a malicious link over WhatsApp. When opened, the spyware can access a phone’s cameras and microphone and can exfiltrate the phone’s data. Predator — unlike Pegasus — lacks the ability to silently infect a phone without any user interaction, but it makes up for that with persistence. Citizen Lab said the spyware can survive a reboot of an iPhone — typically clearing any spyware lurking in its memory — by creating an automation using the Shortcuts feature built into iOS. The researchers said that, “remarkably,” Nour’s phone was compromised at the same time with both Pegasus and Predator, but that the infections were likely unrelated. “Based on the slapdash nature of Predator’s code, it’s clear we’re looking at the B Team here,” said Bill Marczak, one of the Citizen Lab researchers who discovered and analyzed the Predator malware. “Even so, Predator was still able to break into the latest, fully up-to-date phones, so it’s no surprise that we found repressive governments, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as Predator operators.” Citizen Lab said it was likely that Predator is being used by government customers in Armenia, Greece, Serbia, Indonesia, Madagascar and Oman — plus Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which are known to target their critics with mobile spyware. Meta, meanwhile, said its investigation found Predator customers in Vietnam, the Philippines and Germany. Cytrox CEO Ivo Malinkovski could not be reached for comment; an email sent prior to publication bounced as undelivered. Meta said that it also banned four other Israeli companies involved in the surveillance-for-hire business: Cobwebs, Cognyte, Black Cube and Bluehawk. In addition, it banned BellTrox, an Indian hacking outfit accused of hacking into thousands of email accounts belonging to politicians and government officials, and a China-based spyware maker believed to be used by China’s law enforcement. Although NSO has faced legal challenges and restrictions on its business dealings in large part because of accusations of abuse and spying on members of civil society — claims that the company has repeatedly denied — the social media giant warned that the growing surveillance industry continues to proliferate regardless. “We will continue to investigate and enforce against anyone abusing our apps,” Meta’s report said. “However, these cyber mercenaries work across many platforms and national boundaries. Their capabilities are used by both nation-states and private enterprises, and effectively lower the barrier to entry for anyone willing to pay. For their targets, it is often impossible to know they are being surveilled across the internet.” You can contact this reporter securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849.

The new feature will allow users to further integrate their Instagram profiles into websites such as blogs and portfolios. The social media giant says the feature is currently only available in the U.S. Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced the launch of the new feature in a video posted to Twitter. “You’ve been able to embed an Instagram photo or Instagram video into a website for many years now,” Mosseri explained in the video. “This extends on that idea and allows you to embed a miniature version of your Instagram profile on a website.

The company launched a new “Reels Visual Replies” feature that lets users reply to comments on posts with Reels. Now, when users choose to reply to a comment, they’ll see a new option that allows them to select the Reels button to create a video reply. The video reply will appear as a sticker. The new feature is similar to TikTok’s video replies, which allow users to reply to comments on their content with video responses. TikTok rolled out the feature last year to give users a way to offer more context about their videos and answer questions. Considering the popularity of TikTok’s feature, it’s no surprise that Instagram launched a similar feature for its own TikTok-clone. Instagram also wasn’t the only one in doing so, as Pinterest rolled out the option to allow users to reply to comments with videos a few days after Instagram announced its feature. The third new feature mentioned in Mosseri’s video is a new end-of-year “Playback” IG Stories time capsule feature. The feature leverages the platform’s Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. Instagram suggests Playback posts for you, but you also have the option to pick what you want to share. The new feature is currently available to users for “several weeks.”"

The deal follows Spotify’s earlier acquisitions in the podcast technology market, including last year’s deal for hosting and ad company Megaphone, and, more recently, podcast discovery platform Podz. The company has also acquired creator-facing tools like Anchor and the live talk show platform from Betty Labs, now Spotify Greenroom, among other podcast studios like Gimlet, Parcast and The Ringer. With Whooshkaa, Spotify is gaining a new tool: specialized technology that allows radio broadcasters to easily turn their existing audio content into on-demand podcast programming. This is the part that most interested Spotify, which says it will integrate this “broadcast-to-podcast” tech directly into Megaphone — the latter which already offers a suite of hosting, distribution, reporting and monetization tools for podcasters. Spotify believes Whooshkaa’s porting capability will bring more third-party content to its Spotify Audience Network, which would increase the reach and impact for its advertising partners. This part of Spotify’s business has been scaling upwards. The company passed the €1 billion in advertising revenue milestone in 2021 and Spotify reported its highest ad revenue quarter ever in Q3. Today, 1 in 5 Spotify advertisers are using the Spotify Audience Network and opted-in Megaphone podcast publishers have seen a double-digit increase in fill rates, Spotify says. Launched in 2016, Whooshkaa has also innovated in areas like text-to-speech, speech-to-text, connected home integration, ad technology with dynamic insertion, enterprise-grade private podcasting tools and more, the Australian firm’s CEO Rob Loewenthal noted in its own announcement on the company blog. However, Spotify — with its over 381 million monthly listeners — allows Whooshkaa to bring its technology to a larger audience. “We believe the worldwide growth potential for digital audio is still largely untapped. Through the addition of these new tools as well as the innovative team behind them, we are reinforcing our commitment to helping creators, publishers, and advertisers realize the value of this opportunity,” said Spotify’s Chief Content & Advertising Business Officer, Dawn Ostroff, in a statement about the deal. “With Whooshkaa, we will strengthen our efforts to help audio publishers of all kinds grow their podcast business and scale our ability to help advertisers reach their audiences.” Spotify declined to share the deal terms, and couldn’t yet comment on the transition plan for Whooshkaa’s existing customers. A total of 12 people will be joining Spotify as a part of this deal, and they will remain based in Australia.  "

I’ve been pushing for this for a while now — and not just because it’s a shorter flight for me. Berkeley has been great to us — and hey, it’s more or less home for me (one of these days I’ll find an excuse to talk about all of the shows I saw at Gilman St. in this newsletter). But there’s just so much great stuff happening in my current time zone, that I’m extremely happy we’re doing it out east this year — and specifically Boston, where we held the first one, way back in 2017. Like all the ones before it, the 2020 event in Berkeley was fantastic, back in early March 2020, before, you know, everything changed. There was no in-person Robotics Session this year, as the event planning gods probably correctly surmised that this is an event best held in person — because, well, robots. The event is set for the Hynes Convention Center on July 22, 2022. That’s all of the information I have for you at the moment, but you best believe I’m going to be shilling it in here as we get closer.

Image Credits: Paul Marotta/Getty Images for TechCrunch What was the defining robotics/AI/automation trend of 2021? The top three trends in robotics for 2021 are deployments, deployments and deployments. Whether its for safety reasons, labor shortages, increasing automation or all of the above, there have been a ton of robots and robot fleets deployed in the past year. What will 2022 bring for these categories? More deployments means more integration challenges. In 2022, companies will want their fleets working together. That means robots from different vendors are going to need to start communicating with each other because customers will demand it. Believe it or not, there was a time when a Mac computer couldn’t communicate with a PC. We’re at a similar stage in robotics, but the tools are in place to make integration possible.  Image Credits: Symbotic If you’ve been following this column over the past year, you know I’ve been extremely bullish on warehouse and fulfillment robotics. And the investment trends have really borne much of that out. I can’t take too much credit, of course. The writing has been on the wall for a while now for one giant reason… Amazon. It’s the big question on the minds of every company in the online retail space — and, to an increasing degree, the world of parcel delivery. Amazon continues to be a Katamari Damacy ball of capitalism, hoovering up any companies and industries in its way, and leaving even its biggest competitors looking for some kind of edge. Robotics and automation offer some hope — though they represent another space where Amazon has developed its own edge. The last number I saw — published over the summer — was 350,000 Amazon robots. It’s a number that continues growing. The promise of offering a way to maintain a competitive edge against Amazon’s army has led to some of the year’s biggest robotics investments. This week, for instance, Symbotic enlisted the support of Softbank in a bid to go public via SPAC. In addition to raising $725 million for the firm, the deal will give Symbotic a pro forma equity value of around $5.5 billion. A lot of that excitement is built around Walmart’s vote of confidence. In July, the mega-retailer announced an expansion of a pilot program that would bring Symbotic’s automation to 25 of its distribution centers over the next several years. Walmart is also an investor in the company, and if the deal closes in the first-half of next year as planned, it will own 9% of Symbotic. That’s strong support from a company like Walmart, which has been dipping its toes in various robotics verticals — just as Bossa Nova, which suffered serious consequences from an ended contract. It’s hard to blame them for putting so many eggs in that basket. Walmart is the sort of behemoth that can make or break a startup with a well-timed partnership. And as for Walmart, few companies have more to lose from potentially having their respective lunches eaten by Amazon. The company missed a huge opportunity to own online retail early on, and ought to be seeking any advantage possible to make sure it’s got a future, as fewer and fewer people seek out in-store experiences. That last bit is, no doubt, only being exacerbated by the pandemic. These past couple of years have been the final nail in the coffin for countless brick and mortars. Add to that workforce shortages, shutdowns and health concerns, and you’ve got a rapidly escalating list of reasons why so many companies are taking a much more sober look at automating their workforces, for better and worse. And that doesn’t even touch on the whole supply chain thing. When Jack White is launching a tour called “Supply Chain Issues,” you know this thing isn’t going to loosen its grip any time soon. That’s going to mean increased investment in parcel automation and, perhaps, a more serious re-examination of localized manufacturing. The beginning of this year also saw Berkshire Grey announce a SPAC, hot on the heels of a $263 million raise. Locus Robotics (which has insisted on a commitment to remaining independent) has raised a whole bunch of money, while Fetch Robotics went ahead and got acquired by Zebra Technologies. As founder Melonee Wise told me in July: I think it’s complicated. When I started the company, I never really planned on anything. I just wanted to go build something. I mean that in the most sincere way. I wanted to go build something and not fail. And the question is, what does not failing look like? I think the facts are that in the last 20-something years, almost no robotics company has IPO’ed. Now we’re starting to see SPACS, but there hasn’t been a robotics company that’s IPO’ed through the traditional route. I would say that if you were to ask me on any given day, what I thought the probability of IPO versus acquisition, I probably would have said acquisition, because there’s just not a history of robotics companies IPO’ing. That’s for lots of reasons. It’s a hardware intensive business. It takes a lot of technology and investment. Typically, they’re held privately. It’s hard for large corporate entities to have the P&L to invest in this deep technology. I think that’s starting to change. And I think now that there’s SPACs, you’ll see a lot changing in that regard. But I would say you’re still going to see more acquisitions than you’re going to see IPOs for the next 10 years.  Image Credits: ForwardX / ForwardX’s AMR robots seen in a warehouse While we’re primarily focused on U.S. transactions, this is certainly not a U.S.-only phenomenon. We’ve seen similarly large rounds in Europe and Asia, as well. Just this week. Beijing-based warehouse robotics firm ForwardX raised a $31 million Series C, bringing its total funding to around $100 million. With a massive population and the aforementioned global supply chain issues, I’d say it’s a pretty safe bet that we’re only seeing the beginning of some massive rounds in China. An under-discussed element in all of this are things like exoskeletons. They’re not specifically fulfillment tools, but wearable robotics like the newly announced fifth-generation Cray X from German Bionic are going to play a big role in the field. Thankfully, not every industry sees a near-term solution in full automation, so human workers are going to continue to play an important role. That means both the introduction of more cobots and augmentation tools like exoskeletons, which have had a big year, including the recent acquisition of SuitX by Ottobock, Sarcos’ announced SPAC plans and several big raises from companies like Verve Motion.  Image Credits: Stanford University One more quick one this week comes from Stanford University.

2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/sidewalk-labs-products-will-be-folded-into-google-proper/","Sidewalk Labs products will be folded into Google proper","","Alphabet’s smart city project is winding down and Google will take over its products. Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff announced the news in a letter, in which he noted he is stepping down for health-related reasons. A spokesperson confirmed to Engadget that Sidewalk Labs products will be folded into Google, though Alphabet plans to spin out Canopy Buildings as a separate company. “Starting next year, Sidewalk products Pebble, Mesa, Delve, and Affordable Electrification will join Google, becoming core to Google’s urban sustainability product efforts,” Doctoroff wrote. “These products will continue to be led by Sidewalk Labs President of Urban Products Prem Ramaswami and Chief Technology Officer Craig Nevill-Manning, both Google alumni, and the teams will continue to execute on their vision and serve customers.” Doctoroff started Sidewalk Labs within Google six years ago and it later became its own company under the wing of Alphabet. In October 2017, Sidewalk Labs announced plans to build a smart neighborhood on Toronto’s waterfront. Quayside would have featured, among other things, delivery robots and an array of sensors to manage things like noise, traffic and pollution. However, Sidewalk Labs shut down the project in May last year. Doctoroff said at the time that “unprecedented economic uncertainty” as a result of COVID-19 and other compromises it would have to make meant its vision for Quayside was no longer viable. The company also advised on development projects across North America. Several companies were spun out of Sidewalk Labs, including Cityblock Health, which aims to reinvent health care for underserved communities; Replica, a controversial data collection project which aims to revamp transportation planning; and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, which Doctoroff says “pioneered new forms of tech-enabled infrastructure.” Doctoroff said he’s stepping aside after doctors determined it was likely that he has ALS or Lou Gherig’s Disease. He’s focusing on spending more time with his family and fighting the condition. In 2010, Doctoroff started an organization focused on building a new, collaborative approach to ALS research after the deaths of his father and uncle, who had both been diagnosed with the disease.

2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/waymo-says-self-driving-car-that-struck-pedestrian-in-san-francisco-was-in-manual-mode/","Waymo says self-driving car that struck pedestrian in San Francisco was in manual mode","","A Waymo self-driving Jaguar I-Pace that struck a pedestrian in San Francisco on Wednesday evening was in manual mode, the company told TechCrunch in response to an initial report posted on Reddit. Waymo says the vehicle was in manual mode at the time, meaning the human safety driver who was behind wheel was actually driving. The Reddit post from KWillets that described the event included a photo that showed a Waymo test vehicle parked in the Lower Haight neighborhood in San Francisco. A fire truck and several first responders are also shown at the scene. The post from KWillets, who describes witnessing the aftermath of the crash, reads: Just when we thought 2021 couldn’t get worse, we heard a thump. I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Our neighbors had gotten out of a ride share on the far side and one crossed while the other stayed behind apparently taking a picture. An SFPD patrol stopped to say something to her about being careful crossing the street(?), when a Waymo passed in the near lane and hit the one who had already crossed, as I think he returned. The victim was conscious and standing afterwards, but went to SFGH for a more accurate diagnosis. Hope he’s OK. You can say there’s no such thing as Waymo, but as for me and Grandpa, we believe. The incident was then picked up on Twitter, where it received more attention. In one exchange with well-known Tesla fan Omar Qazi, who tweets under WholeMars Catalog, a Waymo spokesperson responded and said the vehicle was in manual mode. TechCrunch reached out to Waymo, which also provided this statement: Yesterday evening [12/15], one of our vehicles was involved in a manual collision in San Francisco on Haight St. midblock between Webster and Buchanan.The vehicle was being driven in manual mode when it made contact with a pedestrian in the road. The pedestrian was treated for injuries at the scene and was transported to the hospital in an ambulance. The trust and safety of the communities in which we drive are paramount to us, and we will continue investigating this incident in partnership with local authorities. The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates autonomous vehicles in the state. The collision occurred when the Waymo vehicle was on a “manual-only mission,” which means it does not meet the criteria for a reportable collision under the DMV’s AV testing regulations, a spokesperson said. However, Waymo will adhere to another DMV state regulation that requires all traffic crashes on roads that involve injuries or significant property damage to be reported. Waymo has been testing its autonomous vehicles in California for years, particularly in and around Mountain View and San Francisco. Waymo has been ramping up its testing activity in San Francisco, which has brought more attention to autonomous vehicles in general, and more specifically to the company. For example, Waymo found itself on the local news after a steady stream of the company’s self-driving cars kept going down the same dead end street, forcing them to make u-turns. While Waymo doesn’t provide exact numbers on its autonomous vehicle fleet size, the company told TechCrunch it has “hundreds of vehicles in San Francisco. Its activity in San Francisco has increased in 2021, particularly since August when the company launched its Trusted Tester program, which opened up its research program beyond employees and to some members of the public. Under the program, San Franciscans are able to hail an autonomous ride in one of Waymo’s all-electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles. A safety driver is still behind the wheel."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/spotify-is-launching-apple-like-ratings-for-podcasts/","Spotify is launching Apple-like ratings for podcasts","","If you’ve ever listened to a podcast, you’ve probably heard a host ask you to leave a review on Apple Podcasts in their end credits. Now, that script might flip to “leave a review on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.” Spotify announced today that it’s implementing a five-star rating system, similar to Apple’s, in an attempt to improve podcast discovery. The company said this feature will roll out in the coming days in nearly all markets where podcasts are on Spotify. Spotify told TechCrunch that unlike Apple, this feature will only support star ratings at this time — you cannot yet write a written review of a show. Spotify wrote in a blog post that its intention is to “give listeners an opportunity to support their favorite podcast shows and enable a two-way feedback loop between creator and listener.” But, after seeking out five-star Apple reviews since the advent of the podcasting medium, podcasters are wary about how much star ratings actually help them promote their shows. It’s a well–documented myth in podcasting that getting lots of ratings and reviews in your first few weeks after launch can improve your chances of getting listed on Apple Podcasts’ coveted “New and Noteworthy” chart, which could jump-start your show’s growth. Besides, professional podcasters have pointed out that Apple itself says that ratings and reviews don’t influence charting. Far too many podcasters (and an embarrassing number of podcast consultants) still think ratings and reviews on Apple Podcasts influence rankings. They don't. They never have. And if you don't believe me, perhaps you'll believe… Apple?https://t.co/ZpmwYWbNeZ pic.twitter.com/TskiHpOFIR — Evo Terra is boosted! <U+0001F489><U+0001F9C9><U+0001F335> (@evoterra) October 27, 2021  A representative from Spotify told TechCrunch, “Ratings are a great way for prospective listeners to quickly gauge a show’s quality, but at this point (as we’re in early days for this feature), a show’s rating is not factored into podcast charts or personalized recommendations.” So, this is a tool to show what fans think of a podcast, but as of now, not something that can help shows get on Spotify’s charts or curated lists. Anchor, the podcast creation platform that Spotify bought in 2019, offered suggestions in a blog post about how podcasters can encourage listeners to leave a rating. “Do you like this show? Let us know by leaving us a rating on our Spotify show page,” one example says.  “As a creator, I can see this feels like a marketing move,” said Eric Silver, head of Creative at Multitude Productions, an independent podcasting collective. “I don’t tell people to rate and review on Apple Podcasts at all because I know it doesn’t do anything other than make me feel good.” It’s a similar marketing tactic to Spotify Wrapped, which trended across social media earlier this month — it’s fun to share your music and podcast listening habits with your friends, but at the same time, it’s a big PR success for Spotify. Even though Spotify’s new rating system won’t impact distribution, Silver says that he will probably encourage listeners to rate Multitude shows on Spotify, at least for a few weeks. Spotify recently surpassed Apple Podcasts in U.S. podcast listenership — so if a large portion of potential audience members are going to see that rating right when they navigate to your show’s page, it makes sense to ask fans to rate your show. YouTube, TikTok and other creative platforms show potential audience members, right off the bat, how many followers you have. But you don’t know how many downloads and subscribers a podcast has unless the podcaster tells you. Even though ratings and reviews are an indication of popularity, this differentiates the podcasting industry from other more algorithmically driven media, like video. “Theoretically, the algorithm is supposed to help you. But isn’t this the tech conversation of our age?” said Silver. “It’s so complicated. It’s not just like, ‘Well, I wish there was an algorithm so there’s more discovery,’ but then the opposite is when you have an issue like YouTube and TikTok.” Creators on platforms like YouTube and TikTok are incentivized to make content that they think the algorithm likes, perhaps more so than what they think their audience will like. But even in media, that’s less algorithm-dependent; like podcasting and even Twitch streaming, there are still inherent biases. Earlier this year, when Twitch payout data was leaked, it was revealed that the highest-paid woman streamer, Pokimane, is only the 39th highest paid on Twitch. Podcasting isn’t known for its diversity either. Even though Spotify isn’t using podcast ratings for algorithmic recommendations yet, it could be part of a larger plan to make it easier to find podcasts. Spotify acquired Podz earlier this year to try to promote podcast discoverability. In the short term, this is a clever move from Spotify to get podcasters to tell their audiences to go on Spotify, since they will need to make their show look good through ratings. This isn’t inherently a bad thing, but as Spotify and Apple compete for the greater share of the podcasting ecosystem, creators can feel like their livelihoods are caught in the middle of a larger tech race."

Byju’s, currently valued at about $21 billion, is seeking a valuation of over $45 billion and looking to raise as much as $4 billion, the person said, requesting anonymity as they are not authorized to speak with the press. The startup, which was founded in 2011 and launched its online learning platform in India in 2015, is hoping to list in the U.S. next year, and also is exploring an additional listing in its home market at a later stage, the person said. If the deal goes through, it would be the biggest SPAC deal to date, surpassing Singapore’s Grab. The talks haven’t been finalized yet and the terms may still change, the person cautioned. Bloomberg News first reported about the talks. TechCrunch reported in August that Byju’s had started engaging with bankers to explore listing options. Several bankers offered Byju’s a valuation of $40 billion to $50 billion if it listed next year, the report said. Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake. The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth and those of several other online learning startups, including Bangalore-headquartered Unacademy and Vedantu. Byju’s, which was valued at less than $6 billion in mid-2019, has expanded to the U.S. and several international markets in recent years and made a series of acquisitions to fuel the inorganic growth. This year itself it has spent $2 billion in cash and stock to acquire 10 startups. Byju’s says it has over 100 million registered users, about 7 million of whom pay for the courses. The startup is aiming to generate revenue of $1.3 billion in the ongoing financial year, it has said. The startup’s unusually aggressive quest for growth has also attracted serious criticism. The Rest of the World and many media outlets have reported that the startup’s salespeople mislead parents — many of whom can’t afford to buy the startup’s products — into getting their kids to join Byju’s subscription. The startup has previously also used intimidation tactics to silence its critics."

Among the updates, one highlight is the update to the Green Screen effect, which the company notes is one of the most-used effects on the platform since its 2019 launch. The tool, which allows creators to position themselves in front of a different photo or video background, will now support GIFs. To make this feature work, TikTok has partnered with GIPHY — notably, a Meta-owned company. With the new integration, TikTok users will be able to select from a library of GIFs to use as their background, allowing for different types of videos. For example, users could record “reaction” videos with a GIF as the background, or they could use the tool to showcase or reference a particular meme. Meanwhile, as TikTok expands to include more professional creators, we’ve seen the company begin to roll out tools that better cater to that particular audience — like the recent test of the desktop software for livestreamers. Now, the company says it will roll out an option to upload videos in 1080p HD. This feature will be available in “select countries” and will be available as a toggle (“Upload HD”) on the Publishing page under “More Options,” if available in your market.  Image Credits: TikTok Another feature is a new Visual Enhancement button which will automatically improve the video’s exposure and low-light conditions and perform color correction. The idea is to offer users who aren’t necessarily video experts an easy one-tap tool that can make their content look better. To use the tool, after you record or upload a video, you’ll tap a new “Enhance” button that appears on the right-side panel. If you don’t like how the adjustments make the video look, just tap the button a second time and the effects will be removed. In addition, TikTok is rolling out new musical and audio effects, including silly features that make voices or other sounds turn into either animal sounds or the sound of a musical instrument, including a flute, suona or a cat. The new features will be available on the Editing page by tapping the “Voice Effects” button on the right panel."

From what we understand, the funding is being structured as a “Series X” convertible note from Guggenheim Partners. Other investors are not being disclosed. The size and nature of the raise, as a convertible note, is a strong indicator that this is a round being raised ahead of a liquidity event for Philadelphia-based Gopuff, most likely an IPO that could happen as soon as mid-2022. The funding process was first discovered and flagged to us by Prime Unicorn Index (which Axios has also separately reported). The round has yet to close and the value of the raise and the valuation are the highest amount as indicated in the filing. The round is coming swiftly on the heels of a couple of other events for Gopuff. This summer, we broke the news that the company raised $1 billion at a $15 billion valuation, and then in November, the company launched officially in London on the back of two acquisitions it had made, of Dija and Fancy, with plans to expand further into Europe. That European expansion has involved some attempted M&A in Europe: We’ve confirmed with sources on both sides of the deal that Gopuff had made an offer to acquire Flink out of Germany — another instant grocery player. That deal didn’t happen — not yet at least — because of differences of opinion on valuation, and a general appetite for getting acquired, according to sources. But it — and now this big funding round — both underscore Gopuff’s intentions and attentions. Flink, incidentally, had also been approached by Amazon and is now being backed by DoorDash, which underscores just how much big competition Gopuff has here, but on the other hand, there are so many strong instant grocery players in Europe that there will continue to be a number of options for it and others.    "

To Cory Levy, the latter has always been more important. The entrepreneur behind First Text, a low-friction service that connects founders to investors, launched Z Fellows last year to test out his take. The accelerator features a one-week sabbatical program that comes with a $10,000 check in optional equity, at a $1 billion cap, to aspiring founders. “The best programs out there, whether that’s Y Combinator or the Thiel Fellowship, require this high commitment, big life decisions,” whether it’s dropping out of school or going full-time on an idea, he explained. “Hey, don’t do that, just kind of simulate what life would be like for a couple of days or a week: if you like it, great, if you don’t, no harm no foul,” he said. Four cohorts in, Z Fellow announced that it is scaling its vision of bringing calculated risk and activation energy to, you guessed it, the crypto world. The new crypto-focused accelerator, which is now accepting applications, will still come with a traditional venture capital check, but will have tailored programming on the sector’s many rabbit holes, from regulation to the best way to utilize technology in a decentralized world. Founders and investors involved with billion-dollar crypto companies will be available for mentorship, speaker talks and daily stand ups, the founder said. It’s the first of potentially many vertically focused accelerators, and Levy thinks that it comes in a makeshift moment for crypto, as billions go into space (and billions more get raised off of plans to). He’s looking for startups working on crypto infrastructure, NFTs, DAOs, DeFi protocols and gaming. Z Fellows offers $10k to stop what you’re doing for a week and work on a side project  Given that Z Fellows doesn’t require the same amount of buy-in as a Y Combinator, quality assurance could be an issue. After all, who wouldn’t take a week of PTO, a $10,000 check and a low-stakes chance to flirt with their entrepreneurial dream? Right now, about one-third of Z Fellows come from underrepresented backgrounds, which the accelerator defines as women, people of color and/or immigrants. For now, the founder is focused more on nudging people to try out an idea versus extreme vetting. Levy still interviews all fellows himself. He thinks the time-bound nature of the fellowship and mentorship is what makes Z Fellows stand out in today’s capital rich environment. “While they may not need capital, I think one thing that is constant is the mentorship and the network of smart individuals,” he said. “And that applies whether you’re working in Web 2.0 or Web 3.0.” 1,000 companies per Y Combinator batch?

2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/who-pays-when-an-uber-driver-is-killed/","Who pays when an Uber driver is killed?","One Afghan family wants answers.","The brother of an Uber driver who was killed during an armed robbery in San Francisco has published a letter to the ride-hailing giant demanding access to his brother’s Uber account, $4 million in immediate aid for the victim’s family and better pay for all Uber drivers. Afghan refugee Ahmad Fawad Yusufi, 31, had been driving for both Uber and Lyft since he arrived in the United States three years ago via the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) granted to Afghans who were contracted to work for the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Both Yusufi and his brother Mohammad Dawood Mommand, otherwise known as Ilyas, worked alongside U.S. soldiers as interpreters for the army. Like many other Afghan refugees and immigrants, the two brothers were resettled in a low-income neighborhood in Sacramento, California, and would head into San Francisco, where incomes and fares are higher, in order to earn a living. “We go to San Francisco for three to four days at a time because there’s more work, then we work and sleep in the car,” Ilyas told TechCrunch. “We try to get a room, but we cannot afford a hotel room. Because for one day, 12 hours of work, we can only make $250 or up to $300, and then if we get the room or hotel we cannot save anything for our family.” Yusufi and Ilyas represent the experience of many other Afghan refugees in California, hundreds if Ilyas is to be believed, who have to leave their own neighborhoods and cities to find enough Uber and Lyft work to make ends meet. “A lot of the resettlement agencies tend to resettle SIV recipients in low-income areas, which are quite oftentimes far away from the city centers or places where they tend to make consistent money working for Uber, so what they end up doing is commuting a distance,” Noah Coburn, an anthropologist at Bennington College and author of “Under Contract: The Invisible Workers of America’s Global War,” told TechCrunch. Coburn has interviewed more than 250 Afghan immigrants who recently moved to the States under SIVs, and said about half of them have worked for Uber and Lyft. “I think from Sacramento to San Francisco is sort of the extreme one but I’ve heard of other ones around LA and in the San Diego area as well where they’ll often work 16 hours straight.” Yusufi and other Afghan Uber/Lyft drivers would often congregate in certain areas throughout the city where they could find free parking so they could rest, sleep or eat — usually around parks, 24 Hour Fitness gyms or Safeway supermarkets, according to Ilyas. It might have been on one of these breaks, which took place around 5 a.m. on November 28 on the corner of Cesar Chavez and Portero Avenue, that Yusufi was shot and killed. He was with a fellow Uber/Lyft driver at the time, who was also robbed of his wallet and phone.  TechCrunch reached out to the San Francisco Police Department to obtain a police record of the incident, but because the case is still active, the SFPD said it was unable to share more details other than what it had originally published. An Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch that Yusufi did not appear to be active, meaning his Uber app might not have been open, during the time of the shooting, and that he had last taken a trip the night before. Ilyas and his brother’s family said they requested access to Yusufi’s Uber account so they could learn more about his last few hours, but that Uber has still not provided access. Uber said it had been in touch with the family to offer condolences and is working to provide access to the account “Most of the time my brother worked for Uber, not Lyft,” said Ilyas. “We have access to his Lyft, but Uber doesn’t let us open his account and get information to see how many hours he worked, when he took a break or stopped to sleep. They don’t want to help us.” “Uber says he wasn’t working at the time, but how is that?” continued Ilyas. “He lives in Sacramento. When he goes to San Francisco he goes for work.” Determining whether or not Yusufi was working for Uber at the time is a tricky business. Uber often doesn’t consider “inactive” time, when a driver is not actively driving to a passenger or completing a ride, to be time spent on the clock. Many gig workers say this type of definition leads to unfair and inadequate pay because it doesn’t account for the time drivers spend waiting for a customer, driving around in search of customers and just taking a break. App-based gig companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash say they use this model of only paying drivers for active time because it allows drivers to be flexible and use multiple apps at once. It is to keep precisely this distinction that those companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars last year campaigning for Proposition 22, a ballot measure that was passed in California in November 2020, which allowed app-based companies like Uber and Lyft to continue classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees. This proposition was in part a response to a 2019 worker classification bill, Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5), that impacts who is entitled to coverage under California labor law. It was under AB 5 that the California courts determined Uber drivers are “employees,” which would mean they’d have access to things like paid sick leave, mandatory breaks and workers’ compensation in the event of injury or accident on the job. California’s labor laws also include death benefits, which include burial expenses and cash benefits to the dependents that the deceased worker supported. Yusufi is survived by his wife, who does not speak English, and three children, including a four-month-old daughter.  Prop 22 also provides death benefits and insurance protection for injuries incurred, at the same rates as California workers’ compensation, but the key distinction is that it only applies to the time an app-based driver is on the app looking for or actively engaged in performing a trip or delivery, according an Uber spokesperson. In August, a California superior court judge ruled Prop 22 unconstitutional, rendering it unenforceable; however, because supporters appealed the ruling, it is stayed pending appeal. That means for the moment, at least, Prop 22 is still in effect, according to William B. Gould IV, a professor of law at Stanford Law School and author of “For Labor to Build Upon: Wars, Depression and Pandemic.” If the appeal is not granted, then Yusufi’s family might have a case. “Without providing a legal opinion, I believe that a persuasive argument can be made that since Uber drivers are now classified as employees, Uber would be responsible for compensating for work-related injuries,” Samantha J. Prince, assistant professor of law at Penn State Dickinson Law, told TechCrunch. “If that part is proven, then a court would have to determine whether this tragic death is a work-related injury.” Whether or not it falls to Uber to recompense Yusufi’s family is up for debate. Coburn says the U.S. military should share some of that financial burden. “If you think about the trillions that the U.S. invests in the [Department of Veterans Affairs] and in long-term health care and the GI Bill, educational support for those that went to war, which I think is a fine thing, the investment for contractors is zero,” said Coburn. “And then you had senators and Congresspeople who felt bad about that, as they should have, and so they designed the SIV program to give these Afghans a visa. But what they did was they gave them a visa and they gave them close to nothing. So there was no retraining. There was no work to find jobs. So the resettlement agencies certainly share some of the blame, but I think this is sort of a wider governmental failure to see the big picture.” Many ride-hail drivers, immigrant or not, come to the apps because they think they’ll be able to make a lot of money, but find that having to cover the costs of gas and auto repairs just ends up sucking them into working more hours to make payments, all the while they’re not building out resumes that could help them find more stable work in the future.  “Uber pledged to support Afghan refugees, yet your company pays wages so low and sustains such precarious working conditions that hundreds of Afghan drivers drive from Sacramento to San Francisco each week and sleep in their cars in unsafe environments — just to earn enough each week to provide for their families,” wrote Ilyas in his open letter to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, SVP and chief legal officer Tony West and SVP of marketing and public affairs Jill Hazelbaker. “My brother and I did the same. And now after all the work we did for your company, you are turning your backs on us in our time of need.” A GoFundMe has been set up for Yusufi’s family."

The round, led by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), follows last year’s $170 million raise. It pushes the company’s total funding to north of $600 million, while placing its valuation “well” north of $1 bililion, earning its place as Europe’s first vertical farming unicorn. “Building a global farming network of our climate-resilient vertical farms is a core mission at Infarm, which is why we’re excited to announce this latest funding round,” co-founder and CEO Erez Galonska said in a release. “This strategic investment will support our rapid global expansion and bolster our R&D so that we can grow more varieties of crops close to consumers across Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East. It’s another step towards meeting our ambition of growing the entire fruit and vegetable basket in the near future, providing premium products at affordable prices to everyone.” Much of the funding will go toward Infarm’s international expansion plans, with sights set on the U.S., Canada, Japan and additional parts of Europe. The company is also set to spread into more Asia-Pacific markets and the Middle East. QIA’s involvement in this round is no doubt a big driver in the latter. As part of the deal, the company announcement plans for a Qatar grow center, set to grow tomatoes, strawberries and other fruits in the region. Fruits have been a big push for many vertical farming companies, as they look to move beyond the standard leafy greens and herbs that have long been their bread and butter, due to the relative ease with which they can be grown in controlled indoor settings. “As a responsible, long-term investor, QIA’s purpose is to create value for future generations. We see vertical farming as a way to enhance food security in every part of the world,” QIA’s Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud said in the same release. “We look forward to working with Infarm to develop their first Growing Centre in Qatar, which will contribute to Qatar’s own food security and economic diversification.” Vertical farming certainly makes sense for the region, affording growers the ability to produce crops in climate-controlled buildings, with far less water than standard farming. In 2018, Crop One announced a 130,000-square-foot farming facility set to open in the UAE. Of course, going forward, such concerns certainly won’t be relegated to a single region.

Investors poured billions of dollars into digital health solutions with great promise of driving innovation in a highly antiquated and inefficient industry. While digital health has captivated the attention of investors and received validation from consumers, providers and healthcare stakeholders, early-stage entrepreneurs are being required to address the highly complicated yet mission-critical question: How can I show value and ROI? 	 With any new innovation, proving out a financially substantiated ROI case requires a combination of time and data, and digital health is no exception. In healthcare, proving ROI ultimately means calculating how much a digital health solution has either improved in outcomes or realized in cost savings for the sponsoring organization and its members. While a claims-based ROI analysis is a crucial long-term measurement of success, industrywide innovation will require stakeholders across the ecosystem to initially think creatively and consider proxies for demonstrating value early on. Rather than allowing claims data to be an inhibitor of innovation, investors must reframe their focus on the long-term direction of the business, the value delivered for the end user and the broader impact of the company on the healthcare system as a whole. Three key questions can help reshape measurement and investment in early-stage startups: Digital health solutions are solving some of the biggest challenges facing our society today. Take access to mental health care, for example. During the COVID-19 pandemic, about four in 10 adults in the U.S. reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder."

In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the FTC alleges that OpenX violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal information from children under 13 without obtaining parental consent. The California-based company is also accused of knowingly collecting information from hundreds of apps marketed for children, toddlers and for preschool learning, before passing this data — including granular location data, IP addresses and unique device identifiers — to third parties that used the data for targeted advertising. “OpenX has received millions, if not billions of ad requests directly or indirectly from child-directed apps, and transmitted millions, if not billions, of bid requests containing personal information of children,” the complaint read. In addition to violating COPPA, the FTC’s complaint alleges that OpenX also violated the FTC Act by falsely claiming that it did not collect granular location from users who opted out of such data collection. Rather, OpenX continued to collect location data from some Android users even after they specifically chose not to have such location tracking data collected, according to the FTC. “OpenX secretly collected location data and opened the door to privacy violations on a massive scale, including against children,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Digital advertising gatekeepers may operate behind the scenes, but they are not above the law.” In a separate statement, FTC Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips said that the order originally stipulated a $7.5 million penalty against OpenX, but the fine was reduced to $2 million due to the company’s inability to pay. The settlement also requires the company to delete all of the ad request data it collected to serve targeted ads and to implement a comprehensive privacy program to ensure it fully complies with COPPA. OpenX did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but in a blog post addressing the settlement it called the data collection an “unintentional error”, adding that an internal review showed that “more than 99% of domains and apps were appropriately categorized.” “We have reviewed and bolstered our policies and procedures to make sure we are fully COPPA compliant, and we will continue to follow strict criteria of both qualitative and quantitative attributes to determine a site’s or an app’s suitability for inclusion in our exchange,” the company wrote.

The company estimates that it represents a $200 million investment over the coming years. 2021 has been an important year for crypto gaming, with Axie Infinity popularizing the play-to-earn model. Some companies, such as Mythical Games, raised massive funding rounds and are working on mainstream crypto games. Tangentially, fantasy sports NFT games could be considered as crypto games. On this front, Sorare raised a $680 million Series B round while Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot, raised $250 million to go further in the NFT space. Voodoo is currently best known for its hyper-casual games, with 5 billion downloads and 300 million monthly active users. Voodoo games include Helix Jump, Crowd City, Hole.io and Paper.io 2. The company has its own studios but also acts as a publisher for third-party game studios. Voodoo’s secret sauce is its tech stack to optimize distribution, average revenue per user and constant iteration. And the mobile game expert doesn’t want to stand still when it comes to crypto games. Voodoo already has 10 internal studios working on blockchain-powered games. Next year, it plans to open another 20 studios focused on crypto games. In 2021, Voodoo acquired eight companies. So it sounds like new crypto game studios could come from acquisitions. “There are few occasions in life when we experience a technological breakthrough that transforms industries. Blockchain will especially disrupt gaming, as players are already used to buying digital assets. This technology will give players true ownership of their digital assets, creating deeper interactions between players — collecting, trading, selling in game digital currencies and game assets — which will increase fun and engagement. This will also enable players to make a profit from their assets, opening up a new “play-and-earn” model,” Voodoo CEO Alex Yazdi said in a statement. So you can expect tradable NFTs in upcoming Voodoo games. They could have a financial value outside of the games as users could be able to buy and sell them on online marketplaces. In addition to Voodoo’s existing stack, the company plans to work on a reusable blockchain stack to manage tokens, create NFTs, create wallet addresses and integrate with layer 1 blockchains (like Ethereum) and layer 2 solutions to reduce transaction costs.

The biotechnology company with headquarters in London and Boston announced $5.7 million in funding, led by Eniac Ventures, to scale its artificial intelligence genome editing technology aimed at improving crops. Phytoform was started by William Pelton and Nicolas Kral in 2017 while the two were finishing up their PhD degrees. CTO Kral was studying plant development biology, while CEO Pelton is a crop scientist. He told TechCrunch that his grandfather was a farmer, and he grew up hearing about crops failing due to the U.K.’s weather and other factors.  Phytoform co-founders Will Pelton and Nicolas Kral. Image Credits: Phytoform “We are lucky to be where we are with genetics,” Pelton said. “You can do the whole plant genome for a few hundred dollars and synthesize the genome as well. Nic and I were PhD students and decided to give it a go, taking technology and applying it to some problems we see.” Current breeding methods to improve crops usually take decades to develop, and genetically modified organism technologies are limited, he said. Phytoform’s approach to developing new climate-resilient crops involves machine learning and genome editing technologies to determine the number of possible DNA sequence combinations in plants and identify new traits, while also reducing agriculture’s climate footprint. Then those traits are implemented directly into crop varieties using footprint-free CRISPR genome editing. The success of CRISPR technology in agriculture has been well documented over the years as a way to manipulate plant genomes to make them more pest and climate resistant and grow more consistent products. Pelton and Kral say utilizing this technology for plants couldn’t come faster as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates up to 14% of food globally is lost every year and climate change will only get worse amid drought, heat and pest conditions increase in the next few years. Malaysia-based Poladrone raises $4.29M seed round to protect crops  Joining Eniac in the round were Wireframe Ventures, Fine Structure Ventures and FTW Ventures, existing investors Pale Blue Dot, Refactor Capital and Backed VC and a group of angel investors, including Jeff Dean, Ian Hogarth and Rick Bernstein. “At Eniac we are big believers in the future of sustainable agriculture with existing bets that include Vence and Iron Ox,” said Vic Singh, general partner at Eniac Ventures, in a written statement. “As the climate crisis worsens, we’ve looked closely at how computational genomics can be leveraged to reduce food waste and bring higher quality diverse produce to market. We were immediately drawn to Phytoform’s founders Will and Nick’s approach of using deep machine learning on plant genetics combined with genome editing to offer a portfolio of optimized produce to consumers.” The new funding will enable Phytoform to expand its team and boost its work introducing traits in tomatoes and potatoes so that there is greater yield and fewer crop losses along the food supply chain. The co-founders say 2022 “is going to be a great year” for the company as it prepares to bring its tomato and potato program to market. They are also working on three other programs and have expanded their geographies from just the U.S. to Australia and the U.K. In addition, they have focused efforts on partnerships with individuals and companies at the beginning of the supply chain — seed breeders and producers — and future plans to expand that to food producers. Meanwhile, the company’s initial business model will be royalty revenue from the sale of the seeds, but expects that to change as its customer base evolves all the way to the consumer, Pelton said. Phytoform started the year with six employees and has now doubled its headcount, Kral said. In addition, it has achieved good technological growth with proof of concept for its AI process both in software and web lab capabilities. “We still have quite a big process on the way to get the tomato program in the late stages of development, but we will continue to do more trials,” he added. “Current technology is taking a decade to generate new varieties, but we are proving we can cut that down.” Bowery Farming is forcing us all to look up at the future of vertical agriculture "
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/carbonchain-helps-automate-carbon-accounting-across-supply-chains/","CarbonChain helps automate carbon accounting across supply chains","","Supply chains are made up of a web of carbon-intensive activities, and trying to nail down which company is contributing pollution along the way has been difficult to parse. CarbonChain, an early-stage startup based in London from some supply chain veterans, wants to make it easier to account for carbon every step of the way. “CarbonChain is trying to track the carbon footprint of everything. And as far as customers are concerned, we’re specializing in Scope 3 emissions and industries where the most emissions are. And we automate that carbon accounting for companies,” company CEO and co-founder Adam Hearne told me. The company’s AI-fueled carbon accounting platform attempts to measure the carbon usage of every asset in the world, certainly an ambitious goal. “So we actually use a bottoms-up approach for every asset in the world that emits emissions, and that’s significant,” he said. Hearne acknowledged that companies will often ignore their requests for data, in which case CarbonChain makes best-guess estimates before sending them to the companies for confirmation. He said that in most cases, the companies are not disputing CarbonChain’s findings. That could be because it generally comes down to money — they need to provide carbon emissions information to their banks. He said that the banks providing financing across the supply chain increasingly want to know the carbon position of the company receiving their money. Hearne cited a study by CDP Financial Services that found that the level of carbon emissions of a company is actually a good proxy for the stability of cash flows.  CarbonChain visual of carbon usage across a supply chain. Image Credits: CarbonChain “So what they found is that if you’re financing something, and it’s very high carbon, it’s usually because behind that investment is a 50-year-old coal-fired power station, and it’s outdated technology. So it’s quite unreliable, and so you might get brownouts on that grid. Therefore, the asset is operating 90% of the time and it could be 99% of the time if it was on a new solar-plus-wind-plus-battery failover system,” Hearne explained. While the company’s tech to measure carbon usage could be more broadly applicable, the founders chose the commodities supply chain first because they see it as the world’s biggest polluter, and measuring that pollution is the first step in controlling it. “CarbonChain’s granular, real-time supply-chain carbon footprinting fills the data gap so that climate-critical sectors, and those who finance them, can take action today,” Hearne explained. The company raised a $2 million seed round at the end of 2020 in an investment led by Lowercarbon Capital, a fund that invests in companies like CarbonChain trying to reduce carbon emissions around the world. Others participating included Blackbird.vc,
Aera, AmAsia, Pioneer Fund, Starlight Ventures and Mava VC. The startup also participated in the Y Combinator Summer 2020 cohort."

With this announcement, Continual is also opening up its service as a public beta, after testing it with a number of select customers in recent months. The data warehousing space is vast but also dominated by a small number of players, like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, BigQuery and Databricks. This makes it easier for startups that want to tap into the data stored in them to build their own innovations on top. For Continual, that means providing businesses with an accessible tool for building predictive models.  Image Credits: Continual “[Continual] allows modern data teams to build and maintain continually improving models directly on top of their data warehouse,” explained Continual CEO and co-founder Tristan Zajonc. “The common use cases we see are things like customer churn, lead scoring, product recommendations, inventory forecasts, predictive maintenance, service, automation, etc. Essentially, Continually maintains both the predictive model and the prediction Using data from the data warehouse and writing the predictions back into the data warehouse.”  Image Credits: Continual Zajonc’s last startup, Sense, was an early enterprise platform that was acquired by Cloudera in 2016, while his co-founder, Tyler Kohn, previously built RichRelevance, a personalization service that was acquired by Manthan System in 2019. In building those startups, the two co-founders noticed the high failure rate for AI projects in the enterprise. Most of the time, it takes a large team and lots of resources to run these projects, all while the AI infrastructure needed is becoming increasingly complex. “We’re moving from this era of big data to this era of big complexity,” Zajonc said. “We founded Continual to solve this problem and to radically simplify operational AI for enterprises. We realized that the rise of cloud data warehouses — the standardization of data infrastructure and the rise of the kind of the modern data stack more broadly — provided us an opportunity to reimagine and radically simplify enterprise AI.” With Continual, data teams can reuse their existing SQL and dbt skills. All they have to do is connect Continual to their data warehouses and then declaratively define the features and models they want to predict. One nifty feature here is that the predictions, too, are stored in the data warehouse, where they are immediately accessible to developers and analysts as needed. The platform currently supports Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery and Databricks and the team plans to expand its partnerships with dbt and these data platforms over time. As Zajonc noted, the company has no interest in becoming a data integration platform, though. “Getting continually improving predictive insights from data is critical for businesses to operate efficiently and better serve their customers. Yet operationalizing AI remains a challenge for all but the most sophisticated companies,” said Amplify Partners’ David Beyer. “Continual meets data teams where they work — inside the cloud data warehouse — and lets them build and deploy continually improving predictive models in a fraction of the time existing approaches demand. We invested because we believe their approach is fundamentally new and, most importantly, the right one to make AI work across the enterprise.” The company plans to use the investment to double its team over the next year and expand its platform to support natural language processing, personalization and real-time use cases."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/ex-uber-software-engineers-raise-3m-for-sperta/","Ex-Uber software engineers raise $3M for Sperta, a 6-month-old startup that wants to help fintechs better manage fraud risk","","Working together at Uber’s risk team, Yifu Diao and Ming Fang came to realize that with the hypergrowth the company was seeing came fraud challenges. Diao’s first project at the company after starting in 2014 was building a rules engine called Mastermind to fight fraud. That engine, he says, allowed risk analysts to build and rollout rules without the help of engineers. “While it was originally built for fraud, it came to be used for other cases such as safety and customer support also,” Diao said. “It was making 10,000 decisions per second by the time I left.” When Fang joined Uber’s risk team in 2016, there was a need to use Mastermind at dispatch time — when drivers and riders are matched. However, dispatch was one of Uber’s most critical systems, and it had a much bigger scale than previous use cases while having a very stringent latency requirement.  “Ming [Fang] did enormous optimizations for Mastermind, which enabled this new use case and brought down fraud significantly,” Diao recalls. Mastermind is now used by hundreds of analysts and ops, and it makes real-time decisions throughout hundreds of user touch points. Diao spent his last year at Uber working on a lending product, which also made use of Mastermind for underwriting. He then joined a credit card startup and realized that product also needed a rules engine to manage fraud, credit and compliance risks.  “What’s more, explainability is important for fintech companies so that they can show regulators how decisions are made,” Diao said. “It became apparent to me that there was a need for a rules engine as a service.” He immediately thought of Fang, who by that time was working at Google leading its Cloud AI Feature Store. The pair had been discussing a few startup ideas in recent years and they decided to team up to form Sperta this June (Sperta means “expert” in Italian) and build their own rules engine as a service. Its mission is to help financial services and tech companies automate decisions and manage fraud, credit and compliance risks. Many of the current rules engine offerings tout a no-code UI to build rules with a few mouse clicks the duo believes that won’t work out well “when the logic gets more complex,” Diao said.  Sperta’s main differentiator from others in the space (other players who have recently raised funding include Alloy and Unit21), according to Diao, is its expression language. “Our target users are analysts and data scientists, who already know SQL,” Diao said. “So we decided to build an expression language with similar syntax to SQL. We had great success with this approach in Mastermind. It made it possible for analysts to onboard in just one week.” Rules won’t perform well if they are not tested, explains Diao. And high false positives can have a real negative impact on growth. False positives can mean a loss of customers for financial institutions and companies. “We are keenly aware of this,” Diao said. “That’s why we are enabling rule unit tests for sanity checks, backtesting for measuring the rule performance and percentage rollout for safely applying rule changes.” To solve its customers’ “end-to-end” needs, Sperta is building a risk decision platform with the rules engine at its core. Sperta also integrates with data vendors, and it also allows analysts to transform features obtained from those vendors.  Just two months after its formation, Sperta raised $3 million in seed funding in a round co-led by Kindred Ventures and Uncork Capital that included participation from some angel investors. It is just now talking about publicly. “Customers can bring their own models too, and Sperta provides a clean interface for integration,” Diao said. “If decisions can’t be made automatically, the cases can be sent to Sperta’s case management tool. While models give us probabilistic predictions, rules give us explainable decisions and deterministic actions. We are really excited about helping the internet make better decisions faster.” Sperta, Fang said, makes it easier for customers to integrate models with its UI. “We can structuralize the data they want to use to detect risk and make decisions,” he told TechCrunch. “We can structuralize the way they use data to make sure their decision making is safe and cleaner.” For fintechs especially, a rules engine is very important at the onboarding stage. Fraud is top of mind for all financial institutions, fintech or traditional. And with more transactions conducted online than ever, the possibility of fraud is also higher than ever. So naturally, fintechs and financial institutions in general are target customers. Competitors, Diao said, charge on average about $1 a decision. While he wouldn’t get specific, Diao said Sperta will charge less than that. The company plans to use its new capital mostly toward hiring. It’s still developing its product but hopes to have an MVP by year’s end. For Kindred Ventures’ Kanyi Maqubela, Kindred Ventures believes Diao and Fang’s work at Uber was “groundbreaking” in the area of fraud prevention. “A generalized, powerful version of a decision engine is sorely needed in today’s market, where software companies are making millions of underwriting decisions every day,” he wrote via email. “Software companies need a solution that is sufficiently sensitive to allow both customization, yet maintain compliance… Successful architecture is flexible enough to be modular, but secure enough to maintain compliance and ease across use cases. Sperta has already achieved this, within only months of being in market.” Andy McLoughlin, Uncork Capital managing partner, agrees that the founders’ insights from having built a rules engine at Uber give them “an immediate advantage.” “In our diligence we heard repeated dissatisfaction at existing solutions which aren’t able to offer some of the more advanced features that Sperta delivers in v1.0,” he wrote via email. “The competitors have done a good job at priming the market but we see a huge opportunity to deliver the correct solution.”"

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Often The Exchange digs into topics and companies that we cannot claim seniority in. Not that we mind, but it’s worth admitting. When it comes to Reddit, however, we have bona fides. I’ve had my account since June 2008, and have been a casual user even longer, so we have the standing to put a few questions into the conversation. TechCrunch has tracked the company since time immemorial. Most recently, Reddit raised a huge venture round at a roughly $10 billion valuation. That means that its IPO is not merely the exit of one of tech’s best-known companies — it’s also a decacorn debut to help kick off 2022. Consider us excited. Here’s what we’ll explore when we get our hands on its S-1: We’re curious about content moderation costs, product expansion, the company’s revenue mix, how frequently governments come up in the filing, and what the unicorn has to say about crypto. A key element of the Reddit platform is independently-run communities that self-police. If you want to better understand what that means, post a Nickelback video in the ProgMetal subreddit. You’ll learn quickly! But Reddit proper must have a material content moderation budget to keep scum and illegal content, as well as government and corporate astroturfing, off its platform. Such efforts will require both software and human inputs, so we presume that this particular cost will prove significant. "

The company already detailed how its algorithm works to suggest videos based on users’ engagement patterns within its app, but admits that too much of a particular content category can be “problematic.” The company now says it’s working to implement new technology to interrupt “repetitive patterns” on its app and is also developing a tool that would allow users to have a say in the matter by letting them pick which topics they want to avoid. The company explains in its announcement that “too much of anything, whether it’s animals, fitness tips, or personal well-being journeys, doesn’t fit with the diverse discovery experience we aim to create.” However, TikTok isn’t diversifying its algorithm because people are complaining of seeing one too many cute puppy videos — it’s doing so because regulators are cracking down on tech and questioning the harmful impacts of unchecked recommendation algorithms, particularly when it comes to teen mental health. Facebook and Instagram execs, along with those from other social platforms, have been hauled into Congress and questioned about how their apps have been directing users to dangerous content — including to topics like pro-anorexia and eating disorder content, for example. TikTok, in its announcement, makes mention of the types of videos that could be harmful if viewed in excess, including things like “extreme dieting or fitness,” “sadness” and “breakups”-themed videos. While a user who shows interest in videos of this nature may find them interesting, the algorithm isn’t yet smart enough to know that directing the user to more of the same, repeatedly, could actually do the user harm. This problem is not limited to TikTok, of course. Across the board, it’s becoming clear that systems designed only to increase user engagement through automated means will do so at the expense of users’ mental health. While Congress is currently most interested in how these systems impact young people, some studies, though debated, have indicated that unchecked recommendations algorithms may also play a role in radicalizing users who could be drawn to extreme views. TikTok says it will also test new ways to avoid recommending a series of similar content when users watch and engage with videos in these potentially harmful types of videos. But it only offered examples of the types of videos it would limit, not a full list. In addition, the company said it’s developing technology that will help it to recognize when a user’s “For You” page isn’t very diverse. While the user may not be watching videos that actually violate TikTok’s policies, the company said that viewing “very limited types of content…could have a negative effect if that’s the majority of what someone watches, such as content about loneliness or weight loss.” Another strategy TikTok plans to roll out includes a new feature that would allow people to direct the algorithm themselves. They would be able to use this feature to choose words or hashtags associated with content they don’t want to see in their “For You” feed. This would be in addition to TikTok’s existing tools to flag videos you don’t like by tapping “Not Interested,” for example.  To be clear, TikTok’s announcement today is only about laying out a roadmap of its plans, not the actual launch of such changes and features. Instead, it’s an attempt to hold off regulators from further investigations into its app and its potentially harmful effects. Its strategy was likely informed by the types of questions asked of it both during its own congressional hearing and those of its rivals. TikTok notes that the actual implementation could take time and iteration before it gets things right. “We’ll continue to look at how we can ensure our system is making a diversity of recommendations,” the company noted."

In line with the iBuyer model, Clikalia guarantees sellers “immediate” liquidity through an offer on their property as quickly as within 24 hours and, if accepted, a sale within seven days. In about 70% of the cases, Clikalia then renovates a property and puts it back on the market. Its mission is to leverage its “proprietary” technology to digitize a historically slow and painful home selling process. “When you buy a home from us, you have all costs in the embedded price,” Moreno told TechCrunch. “If you buy an old home, get a mortgage for an old home and then hire a contractor and architect for a renovation, that will cost you 4x more than it costs us. And you have to get a  consumer loan to finance the renovation. With Clikalia, it’s just one mortgage and you’re ready to go.” In November of 2020, the company raised about $14 million in equity. Today, it operates in Spain and Mexico, with plans to open in Portugal in January 2022 and expand across Europe over time.  It is planning to use its new capital to do more acquisitions, and, naturally, do some hiring. Currently, about 70% of its executive team are women. Miguel Nigorra, partner and head of Europe for Fifth Wall, said his firm was impressed by the founding team, which had a previous successful exit as well as the market opportunity, as well as the company’s “amazing” unit economics and metrics “compared to many other companies in the market.” “The Spanish market is one of the largest markets in Europe when it comes to residential real estate — with the equivalent of over 300,000 transactions per year,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s a massive market, and the process of selling a home in Europe and Spain specifically is extraordinarily time consuming, expensive and inconvenient. We’re excited about the technology angle Clikalia is bringing to a very old fashioned vertical in the real estate market.”"
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/managexr-grabs-4-million-seed-round-to-scale-xr-business/","ManageXR grabs $4 million seed round to scale XR business ","","ManageXR announced today it has raised a $4 million seed round led by Rally Ventures, with venture partner and previous lead angel investor Jay Borenstein joining the company’s board of directors.  With the latest funding, ManageXR will support its expanding team and go-to-market strategy as the company has experienced rapid growth since becoming available to beta users in November 2019 and officially launching in April 2021. The startup will continue to look for ways to expand its partner network of hardware and software companies across the globe, Luke Wilson, founder and CEO of ManageXR told TechCrunch. The company will focus more on large enterprises next year, he added.  ManageXR built an enterprise device management platform designed for VR and AR devices to serve as the core infrastructure for organizations. Its platform looks to scale enterprises’ XR deployments, enabling them to control remotely every aspect of their XR device fleet, including distributing apps and files, customizing the home screen user experience, tracking device health and usage and more.  “Device management solutions have been around for years, but until recently, there hasn’t been a viable option for VR and AR devices. We’re solving that problem for businesses at an inflection point in the industry,” Wilson said.  ManageXR has facilitated more than 200,000 sessions to date across thousands of VR and AR devices used by small, midsize and enterprise companies, including XRHealth and Brink’s. The company also recently partnered with Pico Interactive, a VR and AR hardware manufacturer, to preload ManageXR on all Pico devices in the U.S. “We see a growing trend in companies delivering XR to their employees at a very large scale, evidenced by Accenture’s latest deployment of 60,000 headsets. These organizations are using XR to onboard, train, and upskill employees, as well as unlock new workflow, using the metaverse as a new place to communicate, collaborate, and get work done,” Wilson said. “Device management is not a new concept to these corporations, and they understand how crucial this type of infrastructure is to ensure technology can be used in a scalable and secure way.”  Image Credits: ManageXR dashboard / ManageXR Wilson founded ManageXR in 2018 with the intention of building VR experiences for pediatric patients in the hospital. At the time, the company had to develop its own rudimentary device management platform to deliver its content in the healthcare environments, Wilson told TechCrunch. In late 2019, the company realized that every other company, like ManageXR, would have to solve the same problems on its own, so it pivoted to focus solely on ManageXR in early 2020. Its team understands the challenges of using XR at scale on a deep, personal level, and it’s made a huge difference in how they operate the company, Wilson said.  Los Angeles-based Talespin nabs $15 million for its extended reality-based workforce training tools  Its competitors include incumbent mobile device management companies, which build similar tools for mobile phones and laptops, and some device manufacturers. However, XR is a nascent and fast-moving market with different requirements that these companies are not equipped to handle, Wilson continued.  Its customers pay a monthly or annual fee per device, Wilson noted. Depending on the product tier, the licenses cost $7-$10 per device per month. Its premium product tier, which costs monthly $10 per device, is by far the company’s most popular offering.  “Between the recent investments in the space from the largest tech giants and businesses now using VR and AR for everything from employee training to patient care to sales enablement, extended reality in the enterprise is at the cusp of mass adoption and we’re thrilled to have Rally Ventures join us for the ride,” Wilson said.  “XR is set to fundamentally change how we conduct business, collaborate, and experience the world in our professional and personal lives, but as adoption increases, so do the challenges that businesses face in successfully implementing their programs,” said Jay Borenstein, venture partner at Rally Ventures. “I am very excited to support Luke and his growing team as they accelerate how corporations can manage and benefit from XR devices at scale and ultimately bring enterprise-wide XR to the mainstream.” Qualcomm launches new AR dev kit, acquires Clay AIR "

Index Ventures led the round, with a number of prior investors contributing as well. Before its new investment, Gtmhub had raised just over $40 million in total, making its Series C around triple its prior aggregate capital base. The OKR software market that the startup competes in has had a busy year, helping make the huge round more understandable than it is when simply compared to Gtmhub’s far-smaller Series A and B rounds. Competitor Ally sold to Microsoft, and rival WorkBoard raised a $75 million round earlier in the year. Most recently, smaller OKR player Koan shut down, eventually selling to Gtmhub. TechCrunch’s prior notes regarding the OKR software market’s rise here and here provide more context. TechCrunch caught up with Gtmhub COO Seth Elliott to chat about the round, and how quickly his startup may be able to grow next year. Math, in part, per Elliott. It was time for Gtmhub to raise more capital, but given venture mathematics, it could not have raised a much smaller amount, he said. In a $50 million investment, Elliott explained, there wouldn’t have been “enough pie to go around.” Translating that a bit: New lead investors like Index want to secure a material ownership position in their new portfolio company. And prior investors want to use up as much of their pro-rata rights — the ability to defend valuation percentages in successive venture rounds — as possible, which means that for companies of a certain valuation mark, smaller rounds become an impossibility. No, Gtmhub is not sharing its valuation in this round. And sadly, Crunchbase and PitchBook lack other data points for us to lean on, but we’d be surprised if the startup wasn’t nearing unicorn status after its Series C. The implication of the math point and the round size itself imply that Gtmhub enjoyed a healthy new valuation in its latest round. How did the company manage to raise more capital after announcing its Series B this January? Growth, according to Elliott. The COO told TechCrunch that Gtmhub expects to triple its revenues this year, and perhaps achieve the same growth rate next year. The new capital will help support that goal. Looking ahead, the OKR space is diverging somewhat between players. WorkBoard spends its time discussing its enterprise clients, for example. Gtmhub, in contrast, told TechCrunch about its longer-term plans to grow from a corporate planning software concern — OKR stands for objectives and key results, a Silicon Valley-standard corporate planning process — into something more proactive, perhaps leveraging company data to help customers identify “inflection points” and become more guiding than merely supporting in time. That work won’t come cheap given the cost of machine-learning talent in today’s market. Along with corporate spend, the OKR market may be my favorite startup cluster to track these days. Not only does it feature a number of well-funded startups competing directly, but we’re also already seeing smaller players shake out and Big Tech firms take note. Tracking how WorkBoard and Gtmhub perform in 2022 will be fascinating. Given their historical growth rates, if they have a good next year, each will become at least something near to an IPO candidate in 2023. Bring it on."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/how-to-build-a-better-rocket-company/","How to build a better rocket company","","More private rocket companies are actually now coming online, after years of the field being left basically to SpaceX and Rocket Lab. At TC Sessions: Space 2021 this past week, we spoke to three rocket makers who have either already launched, achieved orbit or are well on their way: Firefly Aerospace’s Lauren Lyons, Astra’s Benjamin Lyon and Launcher’s Max Haot. In our discussion, “New Kids on the Launch Block,” one common theme that quickly emerged was that vertical integration is a key driver of success in the rocket business is driving down costs, especially with smaller capacity launch vehicles. Just as, if not more important, is building a team that can execute with a focus on efficiency, iteration and flexibility. Lyon: I think space tech is all about rapidly iterating, as opposed to working for seven to 10 years on a single product, and having that bespoke application, because it means you have to know perfectly what the future is. And nobody buys an iPhone and then 10 years later says this is the best thing in the world, you want the latest thing. And so similarly, when you think about iterating, and doing space tech, both again, launch as well as on orbit, you really want this iterative approach that’s very focused on customers, as opposed to kind of the old school way of doing aerospace. I think that’s a key way to think about the future. Similarly, when we think about how we operate inside Astra, we think very hard about where can we get this down to basically a robot, where the robots doing the work [ … ] Now, obviously, there’s a path, there’s a roadmap to get there. But getting down to just a few people in mission control, and just a few people on the ground where we do the launch, that’s been something we’ve worked hard on, and recently just made it to orbit with. So I think that is a strategy that is really working and paying dividends. Lyons:			"
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/why-every-vc-should-spend-a-month-with-an-accelerator/","Why every VC should spend a month with an accelerator","See diversity in action, and mirror it|Boost serendipitous, strategic meetings|Reconnect with impact investing","Startup markets around the world are heating up, and more investors are competing against each other for the best deals. In the scuffle, VCs are turning to scouts to do the legwork, but that has meant being yet another step removed from their founders. Investors have already been signing the dotted line without meeting entrepreneurs in person. I’ve sat at both sides of the table as a founder and a VC, and I understand how difficult it is to get them on the same page. However, I believe that accelerators can be the glue bringing the two together. I’ve participated in a number of accelerators, including Disney and Techstars, and these programs gave me a noticeable advantage when I stepped into VC. It helped me understand how founders grow and what they’re looking for in their partnerships. I’ve also seen firsthand that investors have a greater appreciation for building from the ground up after spending time at an accelerator. VCs have to be a direct extension of the teams they support, but they can’t align and succeed with teams if they haven’t experienced one of the most crucial parts of their growth trajectory. In my current position as executive director of PRSTRT’s accelerator, parallel18, I’ve been inviting VCs to visit us and bridge the gap between business and capital. Here’s why I believe every investor should spend time with an accelerator: Over the past year, VCs have been quick to commit to diversity, with 40% of firms putting D&I strategies in place. To give those initiatives the best chance of success, VCs need to expose themselves to the communities they want to empower. Accelerators are hubs for diversity. Most have quotas to ensure programs are made up of founders from all backgrounds, many pair with local organizations to support the communities where they’re based and some accelerators are specifically designed for minority founders (e.g., Techstars Equitech Accelerator) and women founders (e.g., Ogunte). When investors spend time at an accelerator, they listen to brainstorming sessions, pitches and mentorship advice that includes a broad range of perspectives and opinions. They hear about the barriers that entrepreneurs from different groups face and learn what tools they need to overcome them. Likewise, they can take inspiration from the teams running accelerators, who are responsible for recruiting diverse founders, creating safe spaces and promoting equality through their programs. At an accelerator, VCs not only get a more thorough understanding of the people they serve — they can also take the lessons around diversity back to their firms and implement them in the future. They can also bring more diverse startups into their portfolios now, because founders are more likely to trust their pledge for diversity if they’ve dedicated time and effort to an accelerator. Investment is much like dating — VCs could go for 40 coffee meetings a week with founders, but only one or two really catch their eye. It’s not that there aren’t incredible startups out there, but VCs aren’t always placing themselves in the right crowd. When a VC spends time at an accelerator, they’re in front of a number of talented founders at once. What’s more, they’re on an equal playing field as investors roll up their sleeves and take part in the accelerator activities. Investors can get a feel for founder personalities, hear soft pitches and share connections, ideas and commonalities that don’t naturally come up over Zoom. The same applies to founders, who can suss out investors’ priorities and ways of communicating and determine whether there’s business compatibility. Accelerators pre-screen all their startups, too, meaning investors don’t have to perform the same level of due diligence as when meeting a founder cold. The result is a much higher quality of deal flow for VCs. Investors will also be introduced to the greater startup ecosystem where the accelerator is located and network with other players (governing bodies, NGOs, universities) that could offer valuable support to their portfolio companies. This kind of serendipity is much harder (almost impossible) to curate via a phone call. Spending time in an accelerator isn’t just educational for investors, but it can also offer a sense of personal fulfillment that many VCs seek. Despite increased claims of purpose-driven investment, corporate VC firms are often more motivated by strategic payoffs, leaving individual VCs feeling like they’re not creating the political, societal or environmental change they believe in. By rubbing shoulders with the people who are building companies that can enact change, investors can reignite their passion for impact. I’ve seen investors come to parallel18 and be reminded of their core mission. Their recent deals might have been oriented toward investment trends like online gaming, but being part of founders’ discussion around niche areas like tech accessibility and cyberbullying can bring investors back to their ethical roots. It’s easy as an investor to make arbitrary promises of impact. But an investor who spends time at an accelerator and connects with impact-driven founders has greater awareness and accountability. An accelerator offers a strong network of people that can keep investors honest. VC is ultimately about people, not ideas, but in the current landscape, investors aren’t sufficiently getting to know founders or their experience. Being at an accelerator allows investors to empathize with entrepreneurs and establish a relationship beyond the checkbook — one that can encourage diversity, impact and success."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/weight-care-management-startup-found-lands-100m-at-a-600m-valuation/","Weight care management startup Found lands $100M at a $600M valuation","","Just two and a half months after emerging from stealth, weight care management startup Found announced today that it has raised $100 million in a Series B funding round that values the company at $600 million. WestCap — a growth equity firm founded by former Blackstone and Airbnb executive Laurence Tosi — led the investment, with participation from IVP, The Chernin Group, G9 Ventures and Able Partners. Existing backers GV, Define and founding investor Atomic also put money in the round, along with angel investors such as Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Everly Health CEO Julia Cheek. New CEO and former Bumble executive Sarah Jones Simmer described the round as oversubscribed and pre-emptive, considering the startup “had not planned” on the raise process. “I think what was so interesting and exciting for investors is there is this really well understood TAM [total addressable market] — and it’s clear that this is the biggest problem facing healthcare today,” Jones Simmer told TechCrunch. “And here’s this company with a new, innovative approach and a clear product market fit with a business that has scaled very well, arguably operating under the radar without a whole lot of marketing channels fired up.” Since the beginning of this year, Found has seen its annual run rate grow by 6x, according to Jones Simmer. To give some context around its growth, in late September, the company had told me that since its 2020 launch, it had helped “tens of thousands” of members lose over 200,000 pounds, and that it was currently available in 31 states at an average cost of $100 per month, with a variety of plans. As of this month, Found has now helped members lose more than 300,000 pounds (so it’s up by 100,000) and is available in 37 states, with plans to reach the entire country by early 2022. On average, Found members have lost 10% of their weight by month six and have kept it off. The new capital will go toward continued investment in the platform, its infrastructure and growing its user base. “Underpinning all that is hiring,” Jones Simmer said. To underscore that goal, the company recently made two executive hires, naming Dr. Rekha Kumar as its chief medical officer and Dr. Acacia Parks as its chief behavioral health officer. Kumar previously served as the medical director of the American Board of Obesity Medicine. Parks was previously chief science officer at Happify Health.   Image Credits: Found Found was incubated at Atomic, a San Francisco-based venture studio, in the spring of 2020. Earlier this year, it raised $24 million in a Series A round led by GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Atomic, with participation from Define Ventures. And over the course of the last year, it raised $8 million in previously unannounced seed funding, largely from Atomic, in addition to Define Ventures. With this latest round, Found has now raised $132 million since inception.  The startup aims to help people focus more on body positivity and what they can “find” — such as being able to finish a 5K or keeping up with their grandkids or a newfound confidence — during their weight management journey. And it does it by combining advice from clinicians, a community of others going through the same process and “prescription interventions” when deemed necessary. The company aims for a holistic, personalized and integrated approach that includes addressing sleep, “mindful” eating, movement, stress and a person’s biology. Allen Mask, partner at WestCap and formerly of Sonos and Airbnb, is joining Found’s board as part of the financing. He believes there is a lack of knowledge around what is possible when it comes to weight loss. “That’s part of the reason why most people struggle and lose hope. Now, we know it takes more than willpower — it takes science and support,” Mask said in a written statement. “The Found team are leading the evolution of care with a unique vision and have developed a proven integrated weight loss program that combines dedicated medical care with personal health coaching.” Found comes out of stealth with $32M in funding, former Bumble exec as its new CEO "

Uber Eats customers will be able to order restaurant meal kits to be delivered to them via one of Motional’s retrofitted all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 robotaxis by early next year. The partnership will be both Motional’s first time delving into the driverless delivery space and Uber’s first delivery partnership with an autonomous vehicle fleet provider. Motional said this first foray into delivery signals its “evolution to a dual-purpose product strategy.” “We envision our delivery service to eventually be as ubiquitous as ride-hailing is today,” Eryk Nice, Motional’s VP of technology strategy, told TechCrunch. Uber’s not the first big app-based transportation company to partner with Motional. Last month, the AV startup shared plans to launch a driverless commercial robotaxi service with Lyft in Las Vegas by 2023. Motional has historically had more of a presence in Nevada, where it’s been conducting driverless tests since November 2020. This summer, Motional announced plans to expand its presence in California with a new Los Angeles operations facility that would support testing on public roads, and this pilot with Uber makes good on those plans. Motional would not share the number of vehicles it aims to put on the streets in Santa Monica with Uber, but it did say that a human safety operator would be present during rides. Only a handful of AV companies have permits to test in California without a human safety operator, including Cruise, Nuro, Waymo, Weride and Zoox, and of those, only Cruise, Waymo and Nuro are able to deploy AVs commercially. Cruise, Waymo get OK to launch robotaxi service in San Francisco  Motional said it would work closely with Uber to determine what the user experience would look like for Uber Eats customers, but wouldn’t go into much detail. “Motional takes an in-depth, research-backed approach to its user experience development,” said Nice. “This work is already in process for delivery use cases. Our goal is to enable a seamless and intuitive autonomous experience that is informed by end-user needs and delights the delivery customer. We look forward to continuing to refine the experience as we learn more from the pilot.” Motional wouldn’t share details of the operational design domains of its vehicles in Santa Monica, like where specifically it would be conducting the pilot, what hours its vehicles would be on the road, or whether the AVs will be allowed to operate in fog or rain. “We test the Ioniq 5 robotaxi against diverse driving environments and conditions to enable safe navigation during adverse conditions,” said Nice. “We also recently expanded our testing facility in Las Vegas, which will enable us to increase the volume of controlled closed-course testing (by 4X) and the complexity of the scenarios, including more complex urban settings, variable lighting, including nighttime, and light to heavy rain.” Both Motional and Uber said they see AVs playing an important role in the on-demand delivery ecosystem by increasing access to convenient and affordable deliveries, and that they would share more service details closer to launch next year."

The fund is looking to bridge the financing gap for women-led or owned businesses in Africa – where women startup founders are less likely to receive funding despite their increasing enterprise. Women-only founders have received less than 1% of the nearly $5 billion that has been raised by startups across Africa so far this year. “Globally, women have tremendous purchasing power as consumers and controllers of household economics. In the same vein, women entrepreneurs have a significant presence in Africa’s SME sector with African women making up 58% of the continent’s self-employed population. However, despite this economic power and presence, they are underserved as consumers and producers,” said Alitheia’s principal partner in Nigeria, Tokunboh Ishmael. Ishmael adds that the exclusion of women has had a huge impact on Africa’s economic growth as the potential of more than half of its population remains untapped due to structural and systemic issues. “We are proactively working towards filling this gap with a clear mandate to support women-led businesses across the continent while raising awareness for gender smart investment as a path towards inclusive economic growth,” she said. Alitheia invests in growth stage companies across Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Zambia, representing a small fraction of the 55 countries in Africa. By investing in women, the fund hopes to unlock the potential of women-led businesses in Africa, and, ultimately, the economic transformation of their countries. The fund’s investors include the African Development Bank, Bank of Industry Nigeria, FinDev Canada, Dutch Good Growth Fund and the European Investment Bank. European Investment Bank (EIB) joined the round as the closing investor, committing $24.6 million. “Women-owned businesses still struggle to raise funding, although they have proven their performance. I am very pleased to support a true ‘by women for women’ 2X Flagship Fund, which invests in companies creating job opportunities while enhancing diversity in sub-Saharan Africa’s economy,” said EIB vice-president, Thomas Östros. The EIB’s investment in Alitheia IDF is part of its SheInvest initiative which seeks to mobilize about $2.26b of investment to boost gender equality and women economic empowerment across Africa. The new $100m funding for Alitheia comes after it raised $75 million in 2019, which it is using to finance women-led businesses across the target countries. Among the enterprises supported by the fund are Ghana’s Jetstream Africa, South Africa’s AV Light Steel and Nigeria’s ReelFruit Ltd, SKLD (formerly SchoolKits) and Chika’s Food. Jetstream Africa, which raised $3 million in July this year, makes it possible for businesses across Africa to manage their cross-border supply chains by the aggregation of private sector logistics providers at African ports and borders. AV Light Steel manufactures and supplies light steel structures while Chika’s Food, and ReelFruit, which raised $3 million in series A investment two months ago, are both snack manufacturers. SKLD supplies merchandise including educational, hygiene and office supplies. “The historic inability to appropriately capture the economic potential of African women has affected Africa’s development. Alitheia IDF is on a mission to fill this gap by using a gender-smart approach, and financial capital to empower women as consumers and producers,” said Alitheia’s principal partner in South Africa, Polo Leteka."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/clearview-gdpr-breaches-france/","France latest to slap Clearview AI with order to delete data","Two breaches of the GDPR","Controversial facial recognition company, Clearview AI, which has amassed a database of some 10 billion images by scraping selfies off the Internet so it can sell an identity-matching service to law enforcement, has been hit with another order to delete people’s data. France’s privacy watchdog said today that Clearview has breached Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In an announcement of the breach finding, the CNIL also gives Clearview formal notice to stop its “unlawful processing” and says it must delete user data within two months. The watchdog is acting on complaints against Clearview received since May 2020. The US company does not have an established base in the EU — meaning its business is open to regulatory action across the EU, by any of the bloc’s data protection supervisors. So while the CNIL’s order only applies to data it holds on people from French territories — which the CNIL estimates covers “several” tens of millions of Internet users — more such orders are likely from other EU agencies. Clearview AI told to stop processing UK data as ICO warns of possible fine  CNIL notes that it has sought to work with fellow authorities by sharing the results of its investigations — which suggests Clearview is likely to face further orders to stop processing data from authorities in the other EU Member States and EEA countries that have transposed the GDPR into national law (some 30 countries in all). This year Clearview’s service has already been ruled in breach of privacy rules in Canada, Australia and the UK (which, post-Brexit, sits outside the EU but retains the GDPR in national law for now) — where it’s facing a possible fine and was also ordered to delete user data last month.  France’s CNIL found that Clearview committed two breaches of the GDPR — violating Article 6 (the lawfulness of processing) by collecting and using biometric data without a legal basis; and breaching a variety of data access rights set out out in Articles 12, 15 and 17. The Article 6 breach is because Clearview does not obtain consent from people to use their facial biometrics, nor can it rely on a legitimate interest legal basis for collecting and using this data either — given what CNIL describes as the massive scale and “particularly intrusive” nature of the processing it’s carrying out. “These people, whose photographs or videos are accessible on various websites and social networks, would not reasonably expect their images to be processed by [Clearview AI] to feed a facial recognition system that can be used by states [such as for] police purposes,” CNIL writes (translated from French). It also received complaints from individual over a number of “difficulties” encountered in trying to obtain their GDPR data access rights. Here CNIL found Clearview is breaching the regulation in a number of ways — such as by limiting individual’s data access rights to twice a year “without justification”; or limiting it to data collected during the preceding 12 months; or only responding to certain requests after “an excessive number of requests from the same person”. Clearview has been ordered to make sure it properly facilitates data subjects’ rights, including complying with requests to delete people’s data. If the company does not comply with the French order CNIL warns it could face further regulatory action — which would include the possibility of a fine. Under GDPR, DPAs can issue fines as high as €20 million or up to 4% of a company’s annual global revenue, whichever is higher. Enforcing fines on companies without an EU base does present a regulatory challenge, however. Clearview has been contacted for comment on the CNIL’s order. Update: In a statement attributed to CEO and founder Hoan Ton-That, Clearview sought to suggest the company is not subject to the GDPR — although the regulation is extraterritorial in scope, meaning it is applicable and (at least in theory) enforceable outside the EU’s borders in instances when EU people’s data has been processed in violation of the rules. Here’s Clearview’s statement: “Clearview AI does not have a place of business in France or the EU, it does not have any customers in France or the EU, and does not undertake any activities that would otherwise mean it is subject to the GDPR. “I grew up in Australia and have long viewed France as a world capitol of beauty and excellence.  I have deep respect for the country and its people. I created the consequential facial recognition technology known the world over with the purpose of helping to make communities safer and assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors and other victims of unscrupulous acts.  We only collect public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law. I am heartbroken by the misinterpretation by some in France, where we do no business, of Clearview AI’s technology to society.  My intentions and those of my company have always been to help communities and their people to live better, safer lives.” Clearview AI told it broke Australia’s privacy law, ordered to delete data  Clearview AI ruled ‘illegal’ by Canadian privacy authorities   "

It is not disclosing valuation. “We are going to use this investment to double down on our industry leading platform and double our team,” Lyle Stevens, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview over email. “In doing so, we will become the most intelligent platform in the market with the petabytes of historical data we have… This data will power recommendation engines in the Mavrck platform that help connect enterprise marketers with the right creators, the right way, at the right cost.” The company today already has some strong traction and momentum. Stevens said that the company’s “Influencer Index” — as its directory is called — currently lists “millions of contactable macro- and micro- influencers around the globe and across all major social platforms.” Some 500 brands and 5,000 marketers are already using Mavrck to connect with those influencers. And in all, since being founded 2014, Mavrck has connected brands with more than 3 million influencers and creators, reaching more than 240 million consumers, primarily through “native” sponsored content across various media including videos and photos, blogs and podcasts. Stevens said that the core of Mavrck’s technology is based around patented algorithms and first-party opt-in data, which brands use to find and connect with influencers that speak to the audiences that the marketers are hoping to reach. It has build some 25 different search filters — covering areas like audience demographics, historical performance, fraud risk — to whittle down the wider directory to those that match what they need. It then provides a platform for them to engage with each other to work through projects and eventually pay them. “We also have the technology for our customers to invite or import their existing influencer and consumer relationships to develop their own ambassador network,” he added. Influencer marketing spend has become a very big business in the wider area of marketing, rising 55% in the last year, with two-thirds of brands now deploying an influencer marketing strategy in some way. It’s now estimated to be a $100 billion industry. Alongside this, Stevens notes that the creator economy is “expanding rapidly, as more and more people have turned to content creation as a secondary or primary source of income.” He cites figures from eMarketer that estimated that in 2020, 50 million people identified themselves as “creators”. And if you have a child, you might nod a little wearily in recognition at the results of a Harris Poll last year that found some 30% of children said their ambition was to become a “YouTuber” (only 11% said “astronaut”). “We want to support this new creative class by connecting them to the world’s enterprise consumer brands, allowing them to turn their passion into a possibility to earn a living,” said Stevens. The role of a company like Mavrck is not just to connect marketers with influencers, but also to take a pulse on where influencer content is making the greatest impact. Although it’s a very fragmented space — blogs, for example, can still power, especially with certain kinds of products and consumers — when it comes to single platforms with the biggest scale, social apps are still at the top of the heap. Stevens notes that Instagram remains the most popular platform today for influencer content, helped by the social app’s shift in 2016 to displaying content algorithmically instead of chronologically.  But while Instagram still dominates, that is starting to shift. “The Tiktok ‘For You’ Page algorithm appears to be taking market share from Instagram, as we have seen a 400% increase year over year in the number of creators being activated on TikTok by our brand customers,” he said. “If that trend continues, we anticipate TikTok to dominate influencer marketing over the next five years.” Whichever platform ends up on top, Stevens believes that influencers and influencer marketing are not a flash in the pan, but are here to stay. “If you think about the last purchase you made, odds are you were influenced or persuaded by what other people say and display online, versus what a brand said to you directly,” he said. “Those other people can be friends, like-minded strangers or creators you choose to follow online. This concept of social proof has become an essential brand building tool for consumer enterprises. In the wake of COVID and the corresponding changes in consumer buying behavior, consumer engagement with creators has increased 70%. As a result, brands are investing more in social proof to not only thrive, but stay relevant and survive.” That’s enough to influence investors, too. “At Summit, we have invested across the commerce segment – in both brands and the technologies that support their growth – and we believe strongly in the impact and potential of authentic brand relationships as a means to build value,” said Michael Medici, MD at Summit Partners, in a statement. “Brands are increasingly seeking to harness the power of the very long tail of content creators to help drive brand awareness and influence purchase activity,” added Sophia Popova, principal at Summit Partners. “Mavrck’s platform is purpose-built to support brands in these efforts. We are delighted to partner with Lyle and the Mavrck team for this next phase of growth.” Both of them have joined the board with this round."

The startup will use the funds to expand its New Zealand-based team while growing its reach in the United States, where most of its business resides, according to the company. “The market is in the early innings of a transition from paper-based manual processes to the digital solution that Whip Around provides,” said CEO Noah Hickey in a statement. “There is a significant opportunity to help streamline the transport industry and grow the company.” The funding round was led by Punakaiki Fund, a NZ VC firm, and Amplo, a Texas-based VC firm with multiple software businesses in its portfolio, including Intercom, Robinhood and Sharesies. Many fleets in the U.S. are mandated by federal regulations to inspect assets daily and retain inspection and maintenance records for up to five years, and doing this by hand and on paper costs fleet operators valuable time, according to a spokesperson for Whip Around. To solve for that, Whip Around aims to replace the paper-based fleet inspection process with a digital one that makes it easier to track progress over time, hold employees accountable and predict future maintenance needs. “We believe that the digitization of these compliance and maintenance processes will only become more mission-critical as the regulators look for ways to follow on from the [electronic logging device] mandate and other increased reporting requirements being put on fleet operators,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch. Whip Around provides its software solutions to customers ranging from small independents to larger fleets, including Imperfect Foods, Belknap, PODS moving and storage and 1-800-GOT-JUNK?. It currently has a team of 70 in Auckland, North Carolina and Texas, and hopes to use the funding to add onto its product and engineering team."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tusimple-dhl-deal/","TuSimple locks in self-driving trucks deal with DHL","","Self-driving trucks developer TuSimple has reached a deal to integrate its autonomous vehicle technology into DHL Supply Chain’s operations. As part of the deal, the contract logistics giant has reserved 100 autonomous trucks that are being co-developed by TuSimple and Navistar. The agreement with DHL pushes TuSimple’s total reservations order to 6,875 trucks, the first of which will be delivered in 2024. TuSimple disclosed that is it already using its self-driving trucks to haul freight daily for DHL on a San Antonio-to-Dallas route. That route is part of TuSimple’s so-called autonomous freight network. The trucks are in autonomous mod, but always have two safety operators within cab, including one behind thee wheel, in case it is necessary to take over. This autonomous freight network, or AFN, is a mapped network of shipping routes and terminals designed for autonomous trucking operations that will extend across the United States by 2024. TuSimple’s AFN involves four pieces: its self-driving trucks, digital mapped routes, freight terminals and a system that will let customers monitor autonomous trucking operations and track their shipments in real-time. For now, TuSimple will operate the trucks and carry goods for its customers. TuSimple’s long-term goal is to sell its autonomous trucks along with a supporting subscription service it calls TuSimple Path so customers can operate their own fleets. Right now, TuSimple has to be its own operator President and CEO Cheng Lu told TechCrunch. The long-term goal is to become a provider of the autonomous vehicles and supporting services. “That is the way we believe we can scale the number of vehicles,” Lu said. DHL is one of a growing number of companies that include UPS, carrier U.S. Xpress, Penske Truck Leasing and Berkshire Hathaway’s grocery and food service supply chain company McLane Inc. that have joined the TuSimple AFN.  The autonomous freight network, which launched in 2020, now extends from Arizona to Florida. The company is aiming to  to create a nationwide freight transportation network over the next few years. TuSimple is also eyeing an expansion in Europe and Asia. The company is testing its autonomous trucks in Sweden and at the deepwater port in Shanghai. TuSimple previously said the network would be rolled out in three phases, starting with a focus on a service area in the Southwest where it already operates. Phase 1, which launched in 2020 and into 2021, covers service between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. It has since expanded to Florida."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/cockroach-rolls-on-with-278m-series-f-on-5b-valuation/","Cockroach Labs keeps rolling with $278M Series F on $5B valuation","","Cockroach Labs, makers of CockroachDB, has been raking in money this year. It started the year with a $160 million Series E on a $2 billion valuation and ended it with a $278 million Series F on a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the company value in less than 12 months. Greenoaks led the latest round — they were a participant in the prior round — with participation from Altimeter, Bond, Benchmark, Coatue, FirstMark, GV, Index Ventures, J.P. Morgan, Lone Pine Capital, Redpoint Ventures and Tiger Global. The company reports it has raised a total of $633 million with over $550 million coming across three rounds that began with an $86.6 million round in May 2020. That’s a lot of capital, and it’s probably because the database market is growing in leaps and bounds. Company co-founder and CEO Spencer Kimball says that there has been a ton of follow-on interest in investing in the company since the January round, and that’s how this one came together so quickly after the last one. What’s more, he says that there was an alignment between the investors and the company. “You want to have investors that understand the business from their own perspective. They’re asking us to invest as opposed to us trying to convince them that our business is the right one to invest in. That gives a very, I say, complementary [relationship where] their perspective ultimately adds to our perspective,” Kimball told me. The company reports it has 200 paying customers, with the cloud side of the business growing at 500% over the last year and ARR tripling YoY from Q3 to Q3. While the majority of revenue still comes from the self-hosted version, the company expects the hosted version to continue to grow faster over time. They also offer a serverless product they launched in October in beta. This is in line with a recent Battery Ventures report, State of the Open Cloud, that we reported on last month. The company found that cloud-native companies were getting far more revenue growth out of their hosted versions than self-installed.  Image Credits: Battery Ventures The company currently partners with Amazon and Google on the cloud install side, with plans to support Microsoft Azure in 2022. Cockroach has actually had a complicated history with Amazon, particularly when Amazon played fast and loose with open source licenses, and several companies like Cockroach, Elastic and MongoDB changed their approach to licensing to protect against Amazon’s encroachment. Today, however, the company sees Amazon much more as a partner, using Amazon’s services in-house, hosting its SaaS version on Amazon and even having Amazon as a go-to market partner where Amazon sells Cockroach to its customers when appropriate. The company is focussed on keeping the momentum going while expanding the product family, and the new cash should help. Kimball reckons he has at least 3-4 years of runway with this round, and it’s a hedge against an economic downturn and money getting tighter (although there is clearly no sign of that at the moment). Kimball expects this could be the last round the company raises, although he left the door open to raise more if the right opportunity presented itself. As for the future, he says that from day one his goal has been to be a public company and that could be the next step. “<U+200B><U+200B>So that’s our expectation. Certainly our TAM (total addressable market) is big enough and our growth points to it. What we’re looking at now as a management team is what will it take to get there,” he said. The company hired a CFO this year, often the first step before going public, so all the signals are there — the big round, the flashy valuation, the growth trajectory, the new CFO — the company just needs to decide when the time is right."

Only recently Planetly was acquired by OneTrust for an undisclosed amount. And there are plenty of other startups in the space such as Plan A, Watershed, and Emitwise, all with their own take on the market. Now France-based Sweep, which targets carbon management in large enterprises at the FTSE 500 level, is aiming to pull ahead of the pack with a $22 million Series A funding round – one of the largest to date compared with others in the space. The Uk’s Balderton Capital led the round, with participation from New Wave, La Famiglia and 2050. The company has now raised a total of $27 million, less than a year since its launch.  Sweep is pushing at an open door. Last month, BCG reported that over 90% of companies aren’t measuring their emissions accurately and regularly. As ESGs and carbon ramp up the corporate agenda, companies are scrambling for solutions, especially in light of the coming sustainable reporting regulations. Rachel Delacour, CEO and co-founder of Sweep said: “Our enterprise-grade tool is here to make carbon data collection, security and analysis seamless and automated, so companies focus on reducing their carbon footprint and contributing to global net-zero efforts.” 
 
Bernard Liautaud, Managing Partner at Balderton Capital, has joined Sweep’s board of directors. “Sustainability is a huge priority for us at Balderton and Sweep’s mission and vision are perfectly aligned with our Sustainable Future Goals. When we looked at the market, we were incredibly impressed with the strength of Sweep’s team, and the thoughtfulness and maturity of their product.”  Sweep, now an official B-Corp, was one of the few companies selected to present at COP26 at the UK Cabinet Office’s Tech for Our Planet program. It also worked with French investment bank Bpifrance to measure the footprints of two companies it’s investing in: telecommunications firm Orange and education tech company Openclassrooms. Delacour was previously the co-founder of BIME Analytics which was acquired by Zendesk for $45M. Speaking to TechCrunch she added: “Carbon is a network problem. In addition to tracking and analyzing the right data, a company needs to engage with all the stakeholders contributing to its footprint, from a partner selecting manufacturing materials to staff turning off machines at night. To reach their climate goals, companies must continually track all the activities that make up their total carbon emissions, including those falling into Scope 3. The bigger the network, the bigger the impact. That’s why we’ve built Sweep to connect all stakeholders across the value chain, so they can work together to take reduction action efficiently.”"
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/silverflow-nabs-17m-for-its-updated-cloud-based-take-on-payments-processing-technology/","Silverflow nabs $17M for its updated, cloud-based take on payments processing technology","","When it comes to online payments, the front end of the system has seen a massive amount of disruption in the last several years, with companies like Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, Square and others building APIs that make it very simple for online merchants to integrate easy payment services into their checkout flows. But when it comes to the backend, the rails other tech used to actually pass on payment information and make the transactions are more often than not decades old. Now that, too is starting to change: today, a company called Silverflow that’s built a new take on one aspect of that, with an API to enable data-based payment processing, is announcing $17 million in funding to capitalize on interest that it is seeing for its technology among payment service providers. The company, based in Amsterdam, is also going to use the investment to fuel its expansion to the U.S. The crux of what it is doing is providing a super-charged alternative to legacy processing systems, with a wider scope for additional services wrapped around the payments, by rebuilding them as data-based networks in the cloud. “Payments processing technology has changed over the last decade,” Anne Willem de Vries, the CEO, said in an interview. “The cost of bandwidth has gone down tremendously. Older networks were not designed as data systems; they were designed to be efficient. But those limitations are no longer there, and in the data cloud we can do more. So that gives us a good opportunity to innovate.” The Series A is being led by Coatue Management, with past backers Crane Venture Partners and INKEF Capital, as well as new backer Global Paytech Ventures, also participating. The round also includes endorsement (and cash) from individuals that have made names for themselves in the payments business, including Jason Gardner, the founder and CEO of Marqeta, and Gokul Rajaram, the former head of product for Square who is now a board member at Coinbase. Silverflow is not currently disclosing its valuation, nor too many details about its customer base — it targets payment service providers, acquirers and large merchants building their own payment services — except to note that Deutsche Bank is among a handful of current customers and that it will be adding three more customers soon. Founded by De Vries, Robert Kraal (CBDO), and Paul Buying (CTO), De Vries and Kraal previously worked together at Adyen, the Dutch digital payments powerhouse, where the former was running card acquiring and processing services and the latter was the company’s COO. Although the two conceded that Adyen is one of the few companies that’s been tackling the payment processing space with a new approach, by and large they could see that the rest of the industry was running on legacy systems, which were slow, prone to a lot of downtime, and generally not fit for purpose. In the modern world, transactions are essentially just one aspect payments; equally important is the data that comes with that transaction, useful for accounting, for business intelligence, analytics, and more. Starting first with Visa and Mastercard transactions, the plan will be to extend to all card issuers over time. And then, potentially, to other kinds of payments: it’s a very fragmented and highly localized space, but Kraal said that overall cards are still the biggest and most-used common ground among them. “The Founder-market fit is the first thing we noted when looking at the Silverflow team,” said Michael Gilroy, a general partner at Coatue, in a statement. “The depth of experience within payments gives this team a unique perspective from which to solve a problem plaguing the industry – outdated infrastructure. The platform is built for the payments industry of today, and has the scalability, flexibility and usability its partners need.”"
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/meps-back-limits-on-big-techs-ability-to-set-self-serving-defaults/","MEPs back limits on Big Tech’s ability to set self-serving defaults","Big backing for tackling big tech|MEPs target damaging defaults","The European Parliament has agreed its negotiating position on draft legislation to put limits on how Big Tech can operate with the aim of rebooting competition and fair dealing in digital markets. The proposal also takes aim at so-called ‘killer acquisitions’ where powerful platforms buy up smaller rivals or startups to choke off alternative services before they have a chance to scale, limiting competition and consumer choice. MEPs overwhelmingly backed the legislative plan in a plenary vote yesterday — while also adding their own tweaks, including pushing provisions intended to tackle damaging default settings. The European Council, the body made up of Member States’ representatives, decided its negotiating position last month — meaning action now moves to trilogue discussions between the EU’s co-legislators in January, overseen by the French who hold the rotating Council presidency. France has said that passing the legislation package is one of its digital priorities for the Council presidency. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) was presented as a draft proposal by the Commission a year ago, alongside the Digital Services Act (DSA) — a broader update of the bloc’s ecommerce rules which also contains some requirements solely aimed at larger platforms, along with provisions that apply across the board to the in-scope digital services. So while the DSA is expected to require time for all side to reach a compromise (and won’t now face a plenary vote until January), the DMA has been moving at a fair clip through the EU’s co-legislative process — as regional lawmakers find plenty of common ground over the need to rein in Big Tech. With the DMA, the bloc’s lawmakers are responding to concerns that the biggest tech companies hold an overly commanding ‘gatekeeper’ role over digital markets and Internet users which has led to abusive business practices that harm competition and exploit consumers. The Commission drew on its experience of antitrust enforcement against tech giants like Google in shaping the draft proposal — which has faced a string of penalties in the EU in recent years. EU lawmakers’ hope is that a list of upfront ‘dos and don’ts’ for tech giants — combined with centralized enforcement by the Commission itself — will be able to reset digital markets and ensure they are fair and open.  It’s notable that the text approved by a plenary vote of the Parliament yesterday received 642 votes in favour, 8 against and 46 abstentions — suggesting there is broad backing across the political spectrum for clipping the wings of Big Tech. For a little comparative context, back in 2017, a plenary vote in the Parliament on a different piece of digital legislation — the ePrivacy Regulation — draw far less support, with of the (then) 618 MEPs only 318 voting for the draft proposal vs 280 voting against. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the ePrivacy update remains stalled even now. Progress on updating ePrivacy has been blocked by ferocious lobbying from a number of sectors — and also by tech giants such as Google who, in a July 31, 2019 memo which recently came to light via antitrust litigation in the US, can be seen congratulating itself on its “success” at “slowing down and delaying” the regulation, including by “working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other [tech giants]”. So it’s perhaps rather fitting that the giants that make up ‘GAFAM’ (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) are now facing bespoke legislation aimed at reducing their market power and — ultimately — shrinking how much resource they have to lobby against laws they’d prefer not to exist. Certainly it looks like a smart move by the Commission to put the DMA and DSA into separate legislative packages. That has made it harder for tech giants to resort to their typical astroturfing techniques — whereby they draw on an extensive, opaque network of industry associations and thinktanks they help fund, cloaking direct lobbying against tighter regulation of their own business models by projecting their talking points through a litany of worthy sounding third parties. Digging into Google’s push to freeze ePrivacy  MEPs have tweaked the Commission proposal in a number of ways — expanding the scope of the DMA so it will also apply to web browsers, virtual assistants and connected TVs, in addition to the original blend of online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, and video-sharing services — or rather the subset of those companies that meet the relevant criteria to be designated “gatekeepers”. Parliamentarians also beefed up the criteria for being designated a gatekeeper — increasing the quantitative thresholds to €8BN in annual turnover in the European Economic Area (EEA) and a market cap of €80BN. Which may be intended to avoid fewer European tech giants from falling into scope (e.g. Spotify). To be considered gatekeepers under the DMA a company must also provide a core platform service in at least three EU countries and have at least 45M monthly end users, and/or 10,000+ business users. European Parliament’s IMCO backs limits on tech giants’ ability to run tracking ads  The parliament gave it fulsome support to the roster of changes voted on by the IMCO committee last month — which also includes restrictions on killer acquisitions in the case of systematic non-compliance; additional requirements on the use of data for targeted or micro-targeted advertising (but not a full prohibition on tracking-based ads, as some MEPs have been pushing for); and some interesting looking interoperability provisions. MEPs want users to have the option to be able to uninstall pre-installed software applications that big tech bundles with a core platform service — and crucially want that to be possible “at any stage”. A number of Google search engine rivals had been pressing MEPs to beef up the DMA to tackle damaging default settings. And in a tweet yesterday DuckDuckGo founder, Gabe Weinberg, said the parliament had taken “a big step” by introducing what he billed as “a choice screen mandate” to the DMA’s mix. In recent years, the non-tracking Google search engine rival has been pressing for regulatory intervention to ensure true “one-click” competition, arguing that regulation must ensure tech giants don’t simply stack the deck by making it ridiculously convoluted for users to switch away from their own services. “We’re now looking forward to the final stage of talks. If done right, the DMA will let people more easily choose their search engine default,” Weinberg added. Commenting in a statement on the plenary vote, DMA rapporteur and MEP Andreas Schwab, said: “Today’s adoption of the DMA negotiating mandate sends a strong signal: The European Parliament stands against unfair business practices used by digital giants. We will make sure that digital markets are open and competitive. This is good for consumers, good for businesses and good for digital innovation. Our message is clear: The EU will enforce the rules of the social market economy also in the digital sphere, and this means that lawmakers dictate the rules of competition, not digital giants.” Europe’s final push on the Digital Markets Act must include default settings  Understanding Europe’s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook   "

We want to give them competitive edge by automating tedious tasks, so that they don’t have to pay that much attention to compliance and regulation. We see this as a financial operating system for commerce.” The funding is being led by Tiger Global — part of the VC’s very aggressive foray into backing European startups — with previous backers Accel, Visionaries Club, and 20VC also participating. Taxdoo last announced funding less than a year ago — a $21 million Series A — so this brings the total raised by it now to $84 million. I understand from sources close to the company that the valuation is now just north of $350 million. Co-founded by three economics PhDs — Matthias Allmendinger, Roger Gothmann and Christian Königsheim — the three were doing research into VAT. They saw how complex sales tax regimes were for average merchants to follow, but they also identified that there was probably a way to solve that with automation technology. The three have been very hands-on with how the company has developed and grown that vision: I mentioned to Königsheim that when he was talking to me it sounded like he was reading out his company’s press release — not what you want to happen when you’re interviewing someone! But it turned out that he actually wrote that press release himself, hence the identical cadence and diction. (I joked that he might have others on the team dedicated to doing that kind of work these days, he replied that he saw it as his “victory lap” after working so hard on closing the round.) Taxdoo very much made its name around providing a set of APIs that European e-commerce companies, or really any organization doing business online, could use to calculate VAT (sales tax) and to track it to meet accounting compliance requirements. It currently works with over 1,700 marketplaces, online merchants, and enterprises, integrating with the platforms that they use in turn to sell online. (These include ERP providers like Xentral, as well as e-commerce site builders like Shopify, payment platforms like Afterbuy and marketplaces like eBay and Amazon.) As e-commerce has continued to grow, so too have both the complexity of accounting around it, and the scrutiny of the space by financial regulators. On the accounting side, one of Taxdoo’s tools, for example, allows companies to automatically query and pull out transaction data needed to calculate VAT (some transactions are exempt, so that makes it more complicated). Another can pull records and send them for individual filing across different countries or tax juridictions. On the regulatory front, new rules coming into force have presented more opportunities for Taxdoo to expand its own scope of services. Its APIs now include, in addition to a wider set of VAT calculators, tools to manage accounting and invoicing. It also has opened its platform so that third-party developers can build their own tools on top of Taxdoo for customers to use to fit their specific needs (Xentral is an example of one of the developers building apps on top of Taxdoo to make it easier to use the two platforms together). This is dry work, and for many definitely not the most visible part of building an e-commerce business, but it’s essential, and hard, to get right. This also makes the company an attractive partner — or even target — for ambitious fintech companies that are building one-stop shops to service online businesses with all of their payment and financial needs. (Case in point, Stripe has made acquisitions and launched a new suite of services aimed to help calculate sales tax for its customers. It seems that a logical next step would be to dive deeper into accounting around those tax calculations.) “Taxdoo is tackling the largest pain points faced today by e-commerce merchants and marketplaces,” said John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. “Taxdoo’s team uniquely combines deep expertise in e-commerce, automation, tax, accounting, and finance — along with a pervasive customer centricity. We’re excited to support Taxdoo in building the Financial Operating System for e-commerce.”"

In the latest development, Abuja- and Lagos-based Ventures Platform is today announcing the first close of its $40 million pan-African fund. The fund, founded by one of Nigeria’s most active early-stage investors, Kola Aina, has made 69 investments since 2016. Ventures Platform’s news is also coming a day after another pan-African VC firm 4DX Ventures secured the final close of its $60 million fund. Aina, the firm’s founding and general partner, told TechCrunch on a call that when he started the firm, he used his own money for the first set of investments made. Subsequently, Ventures Platform experimented with an accelerator model, where it gave out standardized checks of $20,000 to pre-seed to seed-stage startups in exchange for 10% equity. In 2017, the firm took outside capital for the first time and formed syndicates. Within this two-year period, some of the startups it invested in included Piggyvest, Paystack, Kudi and Thrive Agric. “We wanted to perfect our style of finding high-performing companies early before they become obvious and backing them with everything we bring to the table from our experience as operators ourselves,” Aina told TechCrunch over a call.  “We didn’t want to go out and try to fundraise when we didn’t really have evidence that we could make money out of this.” Last year October, Ventures Platform became one of the local investors that cashed out from Paystack’s $200 million+ exit to Stripe. With a few other secondary exits under its belt, Aina said he felt this was the perfect time for the firm “to go to the market and raise its first institutional fund.” The first close of Ventures Platform’s first institutional fund is undisclosed but Aina noted that “it is a sizeable amount.” Interestingly, most of the limited partners (LPs) involved are Nigerian- and African-based, which speaks to the growth in capacity of local investors in funding the region’s most innovative companies.  Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade is one of the firm’s individual LPs which also includes Gbenga Oyebode. Others involved are organizations such as the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), UAC Nigeria (its first time allocating to a VC) and VFD Group; and global investors such as Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel and Adam Draper. “We’re proud that for this first close, a large part of our capital came from local funding. I gave a TED Talk titled ‘who would own our future unicorns’ and I’m so proud of this because it seems Africans are answering loud and clear that we would own them too.” Ventures Platform was deliberate about wanting local capital in this fund, said Aina. “For us, it was strategic, getting local capital for our first close. But the second close, as you will see, will be from global fund of funds and DFIs where we’ve got commitments. Still, ultimately, as much as foreign capital is critical, I think it’s in the interest of foreign capital to be in bed with local capital from a derisking standpoint.”  Ventures Platform sees itself as a thesis-centred fund. Aina said the fund’s thesis is centred around funding market-creating innovations that solve non-consumption and create innovative new ways to deliver goods and services or services to low-income markets. The firm is focused on six core verticals: fintech, edtech, agritech and food science, healthtech and bioscience, enterprise SaaS and digital infrastructure. Because the pan-African firm relied on syndicate and proprietary capital funds in the earlier stages of its lifecycle, it couldn’t take on follow-on rounds in its portfolio companies which also includes the likes of Tiger-backed Mono, SeamlessHR, PayHippo and Migo. These startups have cumulatively raised more than $500 million in follow-on rounds, and Aina notes that his firm is keen on participating now that it has secured the first close of this fund. “We have a pretty robust pipeline of companies that we’ll be looking at across the continent, as well as our portfolio companies that have raised new rounds of financing. We’re looking for interesting companies that fit our thesis and what’s compelling now is that we have a follow on capital to fund them,” he said. Ventures Platform primarily focused on pre-seed and seed with an average check size of $50,000. But this new fund equips Ventures Platform to participate in Series A deals where it will be able to invest more than $1 million in a single company (including follow-on rounds). The Abuja-based venture capital firm is also deepening its activity in other countries outside Nigeria — Kenya’s MarketForce and Tambua Health, Zambia’s Union54 and Egypt’s MoneyHash to name a few. The firm plans to invest more in these regions and Francophone Africa. Of the firm’s 69 companies, 30% have passed through Y Combinator. Aina says that while part of this success can be attributed to YC being a partner, he believes his firm has a knack for picking quality companies. One of Nigeria’s high-profile angel investors is launching a fund for African startups  Only a few venture capital firms in the Nigerian and African tech ecosystem can boast similar YC stats with Ventures Platform. For startups, being part of these firms’ portfolios represents a marker of success, but some VC critics believe these sorts of numbers are assured for firms that employ “spray and pray” tactics. Aina defends his firm, saying that as an “early-stage discovery fund,” Ventures Platform’s role involves identifying many companies to back early and invest in subsequent rounds of a few.  “I think every fund has its strategy. Ultimately, because of the stage at which we invest, a key part of our strategy is to fund a large batch of companies at the pre-seed stage, and what you see is that the funnel would narrow as time goes on. With this new fund, we now can double down on our winners, which is good for the companies and also good for us at the point of exit.” Ventures Platform said it would onboard well-known figures across African tech as venture partners as part of a move to deepen its expertise further. The first and only disclosed partner for now is Seni Sulyman, the former vice president of global operations at Andela and CEO of BlackOps, a talent marketplace for African venture builders and operators."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/german-revenue-based-financing-platform-recap-raises-111-5m-seed-round/","German revenue-based financing platform Re:cap raises $111.5M Seed round","","Re:cap, a non-dilutive funding platform in a similar vein to Pipe.com and Capchase but based in Europe, has closed a Seed financing round of $111.5 million, in a mix of growth capital and liquidity for the revenue-based financing platform. re:cap’s first product is now officially going live, following a pre-seed funding in May of this year. The growth capital has come from pan-European VCs Felix Capital and Project A Ventures, with participation from existing investor Entrée Capital. The new capital will be invested into further expansion of the team as well as product and entering new European markets from its launch base of Germany. Initially focused on SaaS businesses, it has plans to move into other verticals. The company was founded by Paul Becker (CEO) and Jonas Tebbe (CPO), who previously built the LIQID fintech startup. re:cap allows recurring revenue businesses to fund their growth, but without needing to dilute ownership via VC or taking on debt, with the ability to convert up to 50% of their ARR into instant, non-dilutive upfront cash. At the same time, institutional investors can invest directly in the recurring revenues of software companies. Paul Becker, Co-founder and CEO of re:cap said: “Our funding platform will revolutionize the way software companies finance themselves today. But focusing on software companies is just the beginning: all financing solutions can be rebuilt with the information available in the digital age. Our ambition is for re:cap to become the European champion in this category.” Joseph Pizzolato of Felix Capital said: “re:cap’s speed of execution in their first months has been tremendous. Both their financing solution and their technology with fully automated underwriting and transaction processing are setting standards. Based on their experience and expertise, the team around Paul and Jonas brings all the prerequisites to build a European category leader.” “Today’s newly emerging tech players need money fast to finance and scale their business. re:cap has developed a great new digital funding platform for software companies to finance their business with the right investors quickly. We were the first major investor in Paul’s and Jonas’ previous company, LIQID, and have great confidence in the team to build something game-changing”, said Uwe Horstmann, General Partner at Project A. Speaking to me over a call Becker added: “We operate in a similar fashion to Pipe, less so Capchase. The main difference is that we are live in Germany and we did it at a record pace. So speed for execution is important. We were able to get a lot of liquidity on the market at launch, $100M, so way more than other players when they launched. We basically have a mature product at launch, with deeper underwriting and automation, that works for institutional investors.” “We mainly target on SAAS and software or companies with a tech component, but we’re also servicing consumer subscription companies. We mainly go after companies with recurring revenue models, enabling us to underwrite the companies. In Germany it is a little tougher to think about regulation and privacy, so if you don’t have that then you are screwed,” he added."
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/googles-africa-investment-fund-makes-first-investment-in-ugandas-safeboda/","Google’s Africa Investment Fund makes first investment in Uganda’s SafeBoda","","Internet giant Google announced today that it has made the first investment from its Africa Investment Fund in Ugandan super app SafeBoda. The undisclosed investment comes two months after Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai announced the tech giant’s intentions to commit $1 billion over the next five years in “tech-led initiatives”, which includes a $50 million Africa Investment Fund targeted at early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. He made this known at the Google for Africa event in October. Before launching the fund, Google proved helpful in startups’ journeys via its Google for Startups Accelerator Africa program.  The accelerator program has supported more than 80 startups in seed to Series A stages with equity-free mentorship and resources. Collectively, they have raised over $100 million in venture capital.  Google also recently launched Black Founders Fund, a non-dilutive $3 million fund allocated to 50 startups yearly.  Google sets up $50M fund to invest in African startups  Fintech startups and those from Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa get looked at the most by venture capitalists. Last year, fintech startups accounted for 25% of the VC funding which flowed into Africa, while startups from the Big Four received more than half of the continent’s total funding.  VC firms and institutional fund managers who have spoken with TechCrunch recently say they want to bridge this funding gap by investing in overlooked regions and sectors on the continent. Nitin Gajria, the managing director of sub-Saharan Africa, Google, is one such and he expressed these sentiments when the company announced the Africa Investment Fund in October.  “We are not restricting ourselves to certain verticals. We are focusing on investments where we believe that Google could add value,” the managing director said in October. “If there are founders building interesting products solving real challenges in Africa, that would fall squarely within our investment thesis.” Though Google’s investment in SafeBoda serves as an early reminder of Gajria’s statement, startups from the Big Four markets will likely fill the fund’s portfolio in the next couple of years. The Ugandan startup launched as a two-wheel ride-hailing platform before embarking on a super app plan two years ago.  Now, it offers rides, parcel delivery, food and shop, payments, savings and other financial services to over 1 million customers in Uganda and its second market, Nigeria. The company counts more than 25,000 drivers who have completed over 40 million orders in both markets.  SafeBoda has rarely announced any of its funding rounds since its inception in 2017, but people who know the company’s dealings say it has raised over $20 million. Its investors include GoVentures of Gojek, Allianz X, Transsion Holdings, Beenext, Unbound and Justin Kan. SafeBoda said the investment from Google’s Africa Investment Fund will help “drive its growth in Uganda and Nigeria, scaling its transportation-led app to offer new payment and financial services solutions for its expanding set of customers: passengers, drivers and merchants.” “SafeBoda welcomes Google to their community and are excited to continue to drive innovation in informal transportation and payments in the boda boda (East Africa) or okada (West Africa) industry,” said co-founder Ricky Rapa Thomson in a statement. “This vital industry is the lifeblood of Africa’s cities and powers economic development. SafeBoda is thrilled that leading global companies such as Google see the importance of backing startups working towards these goals.”  A spokesperson told TechCrunch in a written statement that the investment in SafeBoda was made to “strengthen a relationship with a potential future partner that has strategically aligned vision of better logistics and transportation.” Asked about how many investments to expect in the coming year, the spokesperson said Google isn’t setting any expectations in that regard. The motorcycle ride-hailing wars in Nigeria and Uganda are SafeBoda’s to lose "
2021-12-16,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/la-belle-vie-raises-28-million-to-build-an-online-supermarket-from-scratch/","La Belle Vie raises $28 million to build an online supermarket from scratch","","French startup La Belle Vie announced that it has raised a $28.2 million (€25 million) Series B round led by Left Lane and Quadrille Capital, with existing investor Capagro also participating. The company operates an online grocery store in the Paris area. Online grocery delivery services and so-called quick-commerce startups are quite trendy. In fact, it has become an incredibly crowded space. In Paris alone, people can order groceries from Cajoo, Gorillas, Flink, Getir, Zapp and Gopuff (following Dija’s acquisition) — I’m probably forgetting a name or two. But La Belle Vie has been around since 2015. It has acquired quite a lot of experience when it comes to logistics, inventory management and unit economics. La Belle Vie originally started with a focus on fresh products, such as vegetables, fruits, meat, fish and cheese. You could order anything you would find in a local outdoor food market. And it’s true that supermarket chains have often neglected that segment with their online order service. Over time, La Belle Vie has expanded its offering with packaged goods and many of the items that you would find in a supermarket. The company has signed a partnership with Système U. In many ways, La Belle Vie feels like an online supermarket. There are offers and an editorialized selection of products. For instance, you can buy 12 oysters for €4.99 right now. This is the kind of offer you would find in the central aisle of a supermarket. Right now, La Belle Vie offers 17,000 products, including 4,000 different fresh products. The company can deliver your order in less than 3 hours across the Ile-de-France region. It has 500 employees and processes 15,000 orders per week. While it feels perfectly fine to wait a couple of hours to get your groceries, La Belle Vie isn’t standing still. The company wants to compete directly with quick-commerce startups. It has launched a new brand called Bam Courses. The new service is limited to Paris and a selection of 2,500 products. Orders are dispatched from one of La Belle Vie’s seven distribution hubs in Paris and the company tries to deliver orders within 15 minutes. ""I am very proud of the path [co-founder] Alban [Wienkoop] and I have taken. Since day one, we have been obsessed with profitability, with extremely tight control of our margins and supply chain, but also with the social aspect, with the employment of over 600 people on permanent contracts. La Belle Vie is a wonderful human adventure and we are thrilled to be supported in our growth by international and French investors that are as prestigious as they are experienced,” co-founder and CEO Paul Lê said in a statement. Before today’s funding round, the company had raised a $6.2 million (€5.5 million) round in 2018 and and a $13.1 million (€11.6 million) round in 2020. Up next, the startup plans to expand to other major cities in France. While Getir and Gopuff have been around for a while, most quick-commerce startups have been founded in the past year or two. The fact that La Belle Vie has been around for a while is a clear advantage as it has gained some experience over the past few years. There’s a big question mark in the instant grocery delivery space. What happens if VC firms stop financing gigantic funding rounds, like Flink’s recent $750 million round? It’s hard to predict whether customers will stick around once promo codes dry up and service quality goes down. With its slow and steady approach, La Belle Vie has more visibility on its customer base and future performance."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/phylagen/","Phylagen, which tracks indoor microbiomes, is “racing ” to meet return-to-work efforts","","Two years into a worldwide pandemic, outfits around the globe are wrestling with how to resume their in-person operations safely. Consider that Apple just scrapped its office-return deadline, while Google, which plans to require its workforce to return to its offices three times a week at some point next year, made it clear to employees yesterday that if they don’t get vaccinated, they will eventually lose their jobs. “Our vaccination requirements are one of the most important ways we can keep our workforce safe and keep our services running,” said Google in a statement to CNBC: Still, even vaccinated individuals can become infected with variants of the highly contagious coronavirus. Enter Phylagen, a low-flying, seven-year-old, San Francisco-based company that says it’s able to combine microbial genomics and data analytics to answer the question of whether a physical space has played host to someone with Covid-19. How does it do it? In broad strokes, Phylagen employs a network of sensors, swabs, and sample collectors who put the materials into packages twice a week, then ship them to a centralized lab. Phylagen then promises data within 72 hours about whether sick people have carried germs inside a building — which it divides into floors and zones for tracking purposes — or whether the building’s air is safe to breathe. The company calls it “enterprise pathogen monitoring as a service,” and its feasibility has long fascinated founder and CEO Jessica Green, a former biology professor who is formally trained as both a civil engineer and a microbiome scientist. It was a lonely obsession until recently, however. As Green explains it: “We spend 90% of our time indoors and know nothing about what we’re breathing in, even while during this very conversation, we’ll both emit millions of micro organisms and inhale hundreds and thousands of viruses, bacteria, and molds that [can have] really severe consequences for our health and well-being.” While she “knew this decades ago,” she adds, the public’s understanding has “come to fruition with this pandemic.” Disease-related risk management is now a thing, and this young startup is at the forefront  Phylagen wasn’t always so focused on the air we breathe. From its earliest days until some time last spring, the company operated in what’s called the supply chain track-and-trace market, a segment that businesses use to ensure that their products have followed an expected path toward their final destination. (Detours can mean products have been tampered with, which can ruin a company’s reputation or even lead to deadly consequences, especially when it comes to pharmaceuticals.) Green suggests there was interest in the product as a means to track Covid as the pandemic took hold, but as it became clearer that the virus was spreading through aerosols and not surfaces, Phylagen pivoted completely to another application of Phylagen’s  technology. It began to use its learnings — and its ever-growing database of microorganisms — not for traceability applications, but instead to enter buildings, capture the microorganisms found there, then digitize the information and push it out to customers. Apparently, there are a growing number of them. While Green declined to name specific clients, saying only that Phylagen is working closely with numerous big tech companies and commercial real estate companies, she said the business, cofounded by  Harrison Dillon — he previously cofounded the industrial biotech firm Solazyme — is going like gangbusters heading into 2022. Revenue, she says, has grown 10 times year over year. The company has 40 employees up from 20. Phylagen plans to double headcount again, in fact, aided by strategic funding the company quietly raised this past summer from Johnson Controls, a publicly traded European conglomerate that produces fire, HVAC, and security equipment for buildings. Altogether, Phylagen has raised $30 million to date, including from 3M, Breakout Ventures, and Cultivian Sandbox. Of course, questions remain, including whether Phylagen can outmaneuver rivals that are springing up in the space. “There are emerging competitors because this is the new normal,” acknowledges Green. “Everybody is going to be demanding healthy indoor air, and there are currently very antiquated ways of measuring indoor air quality, and no affordable, reliable ways to test for anything biological that’s air-related.” Phylagen’s own processes may seem antiquated to those who don’t want to wait up to 72 hours for results from either the labs that Phylagen owns (it has one in San Francisco and another in Manhattan) or with which it partners. After all, given how quickly the coronavirus is still spreading, two or three days might sound to some potential customers like an eternity. [Update: After publication of this post, Phylagen reached out to say that Green misspoke and that Phylagen can return results to customers within 24 hours.] Green suggests that window will shrink soon enough. “In the next generation [of testing], everything will be automated and on site. Imagine a CO2 sensor or Nest thermostat that gives information on temperature and relative humidity. There is a clear path to being able to detect DNA and RNA that is airborne in a similar way, and that’s what we’re working toward.” Certainly, if Phylagen fulfills its potential, its opportunities look, well, significant. For one thing, Phylagen can test for much more than Covid-19 and says that allergens are also on its road map. Beyond its commercial possibilities, there is also the home. Already, early investor 3M appears to be champing at the bit to develop data-driven consumer products. It even began selling a home cleanliness kit in September using Phylagen’s technology, though judging by the kit’s price on Amazon — it costs roughly $180 –it’s too expensive for most homeowners to consider at this point and is more of a trial balloon. In the meantime, Green insists that the company remains entirely focused for now on its enterprise customers, in part because it doesn’t have time to consider other products, not anytime soon. “The main thing to take away from that [3M] product is that we can really make any menu of organisms that we want to test for,” she says. “But the most relevant and the largest market opportunity and the biggest market need right now is the commercial building space.  "

It had plans to close out the round, a Series F, at $700 million at the time. The company’s CEO Steve Huffman told the New York Times that Fidelity’s investment would give it more time to decide when and how to go public. Now the news is out that the 16-year-old site has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public, the company said Wednesday evening. Reddit has not yet determined how many shares to offer or the price range for its initial public offering. There were signs that the well-financed company was readying for an IPO. In March, it announced the hiring of its first-ever CFO, Drew Vollero, who previously worked on Snap’s IPO. Reddit has raised $1.3 billion in funding so far, according to public information.

Lately, a court decision further reasserted the government’s attitude to stifle any bitcoin mining activity possible. On December 15, the court of Beijing’s Chaoyang District heard a contract dispute over delayed returns from bitcoin mining and ruled that the service contract was “void”, according to a notice from the court. The plaintiff took to the court after the defendant, a mining company it contracted, failed to pay it 278.1654976 Bitcoins, which is worth roughly $18 million as of December 15. This marks the first time a Beijing court has declared bitcoin mining contracts null, the notice said. Following the ruling, the court urged relevant authorities in Sichuan, an energy-rich province where mining mentioned by the case took place, to “purge” any such remaining activity. The court ruling, while not surprising, could discourage overseas companies from doing business with Chinese crypto firms. Though China has deemed all crypto transactions, trading and investment illegal, many crypto firms still keep engineering and operational forces in the country while touting services to overseas customers. China began weighing crypto mining bans as early as 2019 and started to seriously ramp up enforcement in 2021. Virtual currency mining is “energy-intensive, produces high carbon emissions and contributes little to the economy,” said a September notice from the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s state planner, and such activities “should be eliminated.” The signed contract, the Beijing court said, “is void because it undermines social and public interests.” As such, its related rights and interests “should not be protected by the law” and the parties involved “should bear the consequences” of their actions.

And while crypto investors are buying up avatars and digital swaths of land in hopes that a digital universe will spring up around these projects, it’s unclear which projects — if any — will stand the test of time. Institutional investors are also making their bets on the NFT “metaverse.” Crypto startup Jadu, which has made millions of dollars selling pixelated NFT jetpacks and hoverboards, has scored $7 million in venture funding from General Catalyst with additional funding from Coinbase Ventures, The VR Fund, Sound Ventures and Guy Oseary, among others. The startup’s virtual accessories can be used with other 3D avatars including Larva Labs’ Meebits and other wildly pricey NFTs like CyberKongz and DeadFellaz. The avatars can be viewed and raced around in the company’s AR app The Mirrorverse, which the company hopes to eventually turn into a full-fledged Pokémon GO-like game. Over the weekend, the company sold 6,666 NFT hoverboards for $4.4 million worth of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. The NFT space has attracted plenty of ridicule throughout the year, though proponents believe that the digital goods are more than meet the eye and allow creators to get attention and bankroll projects that they might otherwise have a tough time financing. Jadu CEO Asad J. Malik says that appetite for NFTs is overwhelming, but that they’re focused on building their broader platform for the time being. “We can milk people right now, like there’s enough interest if we want we could say we’re releasing some avatar and we’re going to do like 1 ETH mints, and we can probably like make $20-30 million like that, but that’s not sustainable and that’s distracting,” Malik tells TechCrunch. “We have enough money, we’re going to build out the AR stuff.

During a TC Sessions: Space 2021 panel discussion on the growth-stage investment outlook for startups, Bessemer’s Tess Hatch, Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire and Hemisphere Ventures’ Lisa Rich shared their thoughts on the active year that just passed and on what’s coming next. We’ve shared highlights from the discussion below, followed by a video of the full discussion, “Backing the Brightest.” First, in terms of the year that just passed, SPACs obviously played a big role in space startups and generating liquidity for investors. Hatch: It’s bringing liquidity back to the investors that invested in those space companies years ago, I think looking back, Skybox, which was one of the first venture backed companies that had an exit was sold to Google for about half a billion dollars in 2014, after it was created in 2010. And not many venture capitalists were investing in space at the time, but they heard half-a-billion four years later— those are good ROI and a short time horizon for my LPs. Then basically every VC invested in one or two space companies, but from 2014 until this year, there weren’t many liquidity events in the industry. Maguire: You know, I think direct IPOs are still the gold standard, and a lot of the most marquee companies will try to do that. But SPACs are a very powerful tool in the toolkit, and it’s great to have another path toward liquidity. And in general, I think SPACs are better suited for deep tech companies than for like, enterprise SaaS companies, just where there’s oftentimes it’s hard to tell long-term stories with a traditional IPO process, whereas it’s much easier with SPACs."

The company is building some weird robotics, and I’m mostly here for it. In addition to the more straightforward car-building fare you’d expect, the auto giant has also given us a walking car robot or two, some wild drones and whatever this thing is. All in all, Boston Dynamics could have landed in a much worse place from the standpoint of robotic experimentation.  Image Credits: Hyundai And now, there’s the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobED). The four-wheel, Segway-style device is a platform in the strictest sense. That is to say, it’s open to a wide range of different applications — and you can also, quite literally, put stuff on top of it. It’s effectively a mobile wheelbase designed for a wide range of environments on which roboticists can build autonomous and controlled robotic applications on top of.  Judging from the brightly-colored YouTube video the company released ahead of CES (where the system will be on display), potential applications include package delivery, the transportation of small infant humans and teleconferencing. Other potential applications for MobED include mobility for people with walking difficulties. “We have developed the MobED platform to overcome the limitations of existing indoor guide and service robots while maximizing its usability in cities by dramatically improving the platform’s overall mobility,” Hyundai Motor Group Robotics Lab head Dong Jin Hyun said in a release. “We are also looking ahead to assess how potential users of MobED will further expand their needs and use for this type of technology.”  Image Credits: Hyundai The system weighs 110 pounds and is capable of speeds up to 19 miles an hour. The built-in battery should last around four hours, per Hyundai’s estimation. The “eccentric” bit reference to the system’s control mechanism. Per Hyudai: The eccentric mechanism-based posture control system also stabilizes the body attitude by adjusting the height of each wheel according to the ground environment. The MobED’s 12-inch pneumatic tires further help to absorb bumps and vibrations.  More on this — and other Hyundai robots — to follow at CES next month. "

The transaction size is $37.5 million. Wuxiaworld, which has grown through word-of-mouth, claims it is now the largest English-language Asia fantasy platform in the U.S. in terms of the number of users. The fans have translated more than a 100,000 Chinese and Korean fiction chapters into English. Approximately 30% of its users are from the U.S and Canada, while 30% and 20% are from Southeast Asia and Europe. The rest are scattered across the globe. The announcement comes nearly seven months after Kakao Entertainment’s two U.S-based storytelling platform acquisitions, Radish and Tapas Media. Serial fiction app Radish acquired by Kakao Entertainment for $440M  Tapas Media aims to turn digital comics into the next big entertainment franchise  Wuxiaworld was founded in 2014 by Jingping (JP) Lai, a former American diplomat and passionate fan of Chinese fantasy martial arts novels, or Wuxia, who started translating Chinese martial arts fiction into English out of his love for these works. Wuxiaworld does not have physical offices, although it is headquartered in Hong Kong, Lai said. It will continue operating 100% work-from-home as it has been since its founding, with founder Lai remaining CEO of the Asia fantasy storytelling platform, Lai told TechCrunch. Wuxiaworld expects to launch more content in its platform with Kakao Entertainment’s broad access to the best original stories and intellectual properties in Korea’s fast-growing online serial fiction market and Radish’s strong marketing team (in the U.S.), Lai said. Wuxiaworld also has partnerships with Chinese digital publishers that can create additional synergies. Wuxiaworld has millions of page views daily in over 100 countries via its website and app with a majority male audience. In contrast, Radish’s audience is primarily female-driven, which perfectly complements diversifying Kakao Entertainment’s web fiction portfolio in the U.S. market, according to its statement. “Wuxiaworld is a truly gem of a company. Supported by strong word-of-mouth and an active community, 85% of Wuxiaworld’s total revenue comes through content purchased by a monthly subscription model. The company continues to grow impressively, with annual year-over-year profit growth of up to 40%,” said global strategy officer of Kakao Entertainment and CEO of Radish Seungyoon Lee, who led the acquisition of Wuxiaworld.

It also offers a monthly ad-free subscription model that enables users to read various completed series for free each month and a novel-specific sponsorship program that allows readers access the next chapters of ongoing episodes. Kakao Entertainment’s popular martial arts and fantasy fiction contents such as “The Second Coming of Gluttony” and “Overgeared” already account for approximately 5% of the Wuxiaworld library among the top-grossing intellectual properties, driving almost a quarter of its revenue. “Both companies [Kakao Entertainment and Radish] are committed to creating high-quality mobile fiction, which forms the basis for their strong market leadership in the U.S. and Korea,” Lai said. Kakao Entertainment, which owns a slew of collections of Korean web fiction, will accelerate its business growth in English-speaking markets with Radish’s expertise in delivering mobile novels to U.S. consumers and Wuxiaworld’s commitment to translation excellence, as per its statement. “Radish and Kakao Entertainment hopes to further realize Wuxiaworld’s infinite growth potential to reach a new and wider demographic in the U.S. market,” Lee said. Following the acquisition, Kakao Entertainment now has three storytelling platforms: Radish, Tapas and Wuxiaworld. Having launched across Asia and Europe this year, the company plans to expand further in international markets next year, aiming to triple its transaction from overseas in the next three years. Kakao Entertainment announced last week its webtoon service launch in France as early as this month. Kakao Entertainment opened offices in Thailand and Taiwan earlier this year. It also entered Indonesia in 2017 and India in 2020. Its sister company Piccoma, formerly known as Kakao Japan, provides web cartoons and novels in Japan. South Korea’s two largest internet giants Kakao and Naver compete in the storytelling platform market. In May, Naver has also completed an acquisition of Wattpad, a Canada-based web novel platform.

A separate filing reveals that Canoo will also be exploring a new deal with VDL Groep, another Dutch auto manufacturing company, to produce vehicles in the U.S. “We appreciate the months of effort VDL Nedcar invested to provide us with a contract manufacturing option, but we have concluded that building in America is better aligned with our mission and current focus to invest in the communities and states that are investing in hi-tech manufacturing alongside us, creating American jobs and innovation,” said Tony Aquila, Canoo’s CEO, in the filing. “The support from Oklahoma and Arkansas will allow us to achieve SOP earlier and with less risk on many fronts.” As part of the breakup, VDL Nedcar will return Canoo’s prepayment of $30.4 million, and as part of the new partnership, VDL Groep will purchase $8.4 million of Canoo stock. The news comes about a month after Canoo shared plans to move its headquarters and an advanced manufacturing industrialized facility to Bentonville, Arkansas, where Walmart is also headquartered. During Canoo’s second-quarter earnings call, Aquila had estimated VDL Nedcar would produce up to 25,000 units of the automaker’s lifestyle vehicle in 2023, but it appears those vehicles will now be manufactured in Arkansas. Canoo is also working on its “mega microfactory” in Oklahoma, which is expected to come online in late 2023 and will build Canoo pickup trucks and multipurpose delivery vehicles. Oklahoma committed $300 million in non-dilutive financial incentives to support Canoo’s facility and the next phase of its manufacturing. Canoo has not replied to requests for information about similar financial incentives offered by Arkansas, but it’s likely those incentives exist. The SEC filing states that Canoo will be able to better utilize the incentives from Oklahoma and Arkansas now that the startup and VDL Nedcar have ceased contract manufacturing discussions, and that it can better facilitate its ability to deliver vehicles ahed of Q4 without the 25% tariff that would have attached if the vehicles were manufactured in Europe. With the $1 trillion infrastructure bill officially signed into law, which includes the Buy American Act, it’s possible Canoo will be chasing federal government contracts and other government incentives. The act restricts the purpose of non-domestic supplies, stipulates that the end product must be manufactured in the United States and applies to federal government contracts for products used in the U.S. “In addition, we will be 100% built in the heartland of America, and we have proudly achieved another major milestone of having sourced 96% of our parts from U.S. and Allied Nations,” said Aquila. By choosing a different manufacturing partner, Canoo hopes to reduce supply chain vulnerabilities, increase speed to market, more securely control the creation of additional innovation and IP, increase advanced manufacturing jobs in local communities and save thousands of dollars per unit by “eliminating warranty risks, tariffs and overseas shipping costs,” according to the filing. On Wednesday, Canoo also shared upgraded guidance on its refined manufacturing strategy and production roadmap for 2022 to 2025. Next year, Canoo aims to produce 3,000 to 6,000 units, up from 500 to 1,000 units. In 2023, it hopes to produce 14,000 to 17,000, up from 15,000 units. And its 2024 and 2025 targets are 40,000 to 50,000 units and 70,000 to 80,000 units, respectively."

San Francisco-based Ample is partnering with companies that manage EV fleets to swap its modular battery packs in and out of their vehicles. “Fourteen years ago, Better Place raised nearly a billion dollars to do what Ample’s doing, and it ended up declaring bankruptcy,” reports Rebecca Bellan. In an extended interview with co-founder John de Souza, she asked about the company’s go-to-market strategy, its culture and why he’s certain Ample will succeed where others did not. “The economics and operations work very well because you don’t need a large number at a single station to break even. With a small fleet, you’d have it at max 20 cars and it will break even. That’s what makes it so attractive. You don’t need to deploy the stations until you have a customer.” (TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead. You can sign up here.)

2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/ftc-may-consider-rule-curbing-algorithmic-discrimination-and-commercial-surveillance/","FTC may consider rule curbing algorithmic discrimination and ‘commercial surveillance’","","The Federal Trade Commission appears to be preparing to consider a rule aimed at digital platforms that either invasively track their users or allow others to do so. The “Trade Regulation Rule on Commercial Surveillance” is at a very early stage but could be the first major anti-Big-Tech action by new FTC Chair Lina Khan. It is currently only described in this Office of Management and Budget summary, after the FTC submitted information to that agency on potential upcoming regulatory actions. According to the listing, the rule would “curb lax security practices, limit privacy abuses, and ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.” There is no public draft of the rule and no indication of whether the rule-making is more than notional at this point. An FTC spokesperson offered the following statement, but declined to comment further: “The FTC is prepared to use all of our tools to combat harmful commercial surveillance practices and protect Americans’ privacy.” Senator Brian Schatz called attention to the filing, lauding the agency (perhaps a bit prematurely) for taking this on: “I’m glad to see Chair Khan and the agency take this step to crack down on companies using discriminatory algorithms. It’s crucial that we address this,” he said in a statement. The rule-making would use the FTC’s Section 18 authority to regulate “Unfair or deceptive acts or practices,” which is an established source of authority for establishing a variety of requirements and prohibitions. This rule could potentially be along the lines of the proposed (and discarded) Broadband Privacy Act, among other attempts to shield consumers from the hidden depredations of everything from social media companies to internet providers. Of course the FTC cannot simply invent rules out of thin air — they do establish rules, but it’s often when a new or changing industry has managed to circumvent rules that already exist for good reason. For instance, if a yogurt label says it’s fat-free and testing shows it has fat, that’s obviously false advertising. But if a social media company says (as they often do) that you “own your data” or some such, but you can’t download it, prevent them from selling it or completely delete it from their platform, is that false advertising? It might not be until the FTC updates its rules and guidance to include the practice. “Unlawful discrimination” might also occur when an algorithm fed with badly configured data ends up favoring or disfavoring a group of people based on a protected status like religion, race or medical status. At present there is little in the way of formal requirements for vetting algorithms, as they and their sources are often trade secrets or otherwise shielded from public view and inquiry. An FTC rule could help make this a requirement rather than a voluntary action. Biden elevates tech antitrust crusader Lina Khan to FTC chair  Sometimes these efforts are backed up by legislation or executive action, and Khan certainly has something of a mandate from the White House to rein in Big Tech (her rapid ascendance from legal adviser to top of the heap is a strong endorsement of actions like this potential rule). To be clear, at this point this is more or less a twinkle in the FTC’s eye, but the filing with the OMB does establish it as a likely priority in 2022 — an election year when the current administration would like to appear effective. Taking on Big Tech is one of very few bipartisan efforts extant so work on these lines could be a plank in a few political platforms."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/tiktok-is-testing-a-desktop-streaming-software-called-tiktok-live-studio/","TikTok is testing a desktop streaming software called TikTok Live Studio","","What if instead of watching your favorite TikTok star stream on Twitch, you could watch them play video games live on TikTok? For the last few days, according to the platform, TikTok has been testing a Windows program called TikTok Live Studio. Once downloaded to your desktop, the program allows users to log in with their TikTok account and stream directly to TikTok Live. Within the program, you can communicate with viewers through the chat feature, and you can stream content from your computer, your phone or a gaming console. TikTok told TechCrunch that this program is currently available only in a handful of Western markets for a few thousand users. It's super basic in its current state.  Has both Landscape and Portrait Scenes. Sources include Game Capture, Mobile Capture, Video Capture, Program Capture, and some text/images. No browser sources, or alerts. Emojis are limited to the stock ones. pic.twitter.com/oOHwUbSdUF — Zach Bussey (@zachbussey) December 15, 2021  An obvious benefit for TikTok in testing this feature is that creators might be motivated to stay within their app, instead of asking their audience to watch them stream on Twitch or YouTube Gaming. From the look of TikTok’s promotional images, it seems that the company is catering toward people looking to stream video games. But in its nascent form, TikTok Live Studio lacks the features that seasoned streamers can find on broadcast software like OBS or Streamlabs — which makes sense, as the product is still in testing. For example, even though you can hook up a video game console to TikTok Live Studio, you can’t use browser windows as a source, and you can’t set up in-stream alerts for tips or new follows.  Image Credits: TikTok Live Studio (opens in a new window) But a goal of this feature test is to see how creators use the software. TikTok Live Studio isn’t guaranteed to roll out, the company told TechCrunch — whenever TikTok tests a feature, that doesn’t mean it’s here to stay forever. But if we do see a true launch of TikTok Live Studio, the platform will study what creators are using the software for, then tailor it to better suit those use cases. Already, creators are using TikTok’s livestreaming tools to monetize and expand their followings. Creators can accept tips, schedule events, use live Q&A tools, go live with other users, filter certain keywords and assign moderators. Right now, TikTok Live Studio allows users to choose whether they want to enable gifting and comments, and they can set up keyword filters. But other existing livestreaming features like assigning moderators and scheduling streams could potentially be incorporated into a future, more robust product. This streaming software could also mark an opportunity for TikTok to reach more desktop users. For creators, a desktop streaming software is essential, since a smartphone simply isn’t built to connect to your gaming console and stream at the same time. Though people do watch video game streams on their phones, the user experience is generally better on desktop, which could help users create the habit of using TikTok on their computer. TikTok expands LIVE platform with new features, including events, co-hosts, Q&As and more "
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/voly-raises-13m-led-by-sequoia-to-deliver-instant-groceries-in-australia/","Voly raises $13M led by Sequoia to deliver instant groceries in Australia","","The trend that is instant grocery delivery — online ordering of essentials with your purchases being delivered to you in under an hour — continues to proliferate across multiple markets, and in the latest development, Sequoia is leading an investment in one out of Australia. Voly, a five-month-old Sydney-based startup that offers thousands of SKUs and promises deliveries in 15 minutes at a flat fee of A$2.99 ($2.14), has raised A$18 million (just under $13 million at today’s rates) in a seed round of funding that it will be using to expand its business to cities and towns across the country. In addition to Sequoia, by way of Sequoia Capital India, other investors in the round include Global Founders Capital (GFC) and Artesian Capital, an Australian firm; the latter two also previously backed Voly in a $1 million pre-seed round. At a time when the instant grocery market is very crowded in certain regions like Europe — where a number of local startups are coexisting and competing with some very heavily capitalised players with international ambitions like Gopuff, Gorillas, Flink and Getir — Voly has picked a ripe moment to ramp up in Australia. The market for groceries in the country is estimated to be worth some A$90 billion ($64.6 billion) annually, but while there are some services for delivering so-called “big basket” purchases that are typically made weekly, the field appears to be pretty open for those offering deliveries in under an hour. “Instant delivery is still very revolutionary here,” Mark Heath, the co-CEO and co-founder, said in an interview earlier. “We were the country that got left behind by the other delivery startups,” joked Thibault Henry, the other founder and CEO. “We are a breath of fresh air.” It currently offers some 2,000 SKUs and the plan is to grow that to 3,000, with groceries and essentials also complemented by modular shopping that mimics the concept of meal kits: A customer can select recipes based on preparation time, and then buy the ingredients needed to make them. Heath said this has helped the company market itself not just to the younger, urban-dwelling millennials that typical are the early adopters of instant grocery services; but also working parents “who still want to cook tasty food for their families.” Henry believes the typical Voly user will use its service several times a week. That lack of competition could be one reason investors have been bullish on Voly; the other might be the track record of the founders. Heath helped launch Uber in Australia heading up operations and logistics, and then he worked as the country manager for CloudKitchens. Henry, meanwhile founded and ran a last-mile refrigerated delivery startup, Balto Logistics, which racked up a long list of on-demand food delivery brands as customers. “Australia’s grocery market, which sees $90 billion in annual spends, is a large and profitable space that continues to be dominated by offline retail,” said Abheek Anand, MD, Sequoia India, in a statement. “The Sequoia Capital India team was impressed by the strong consumer love for VOLY, their compelling value proposition, and an impressive team of repeat founders that has blitzscaled businesses in Australia before. With on-demand models traditionally scaling very successfully in the country, the decision to lead their seed round and help them scale their business across Australia was an easy one to make.” While Voly may be a very new and likely very small outfit — it’s not disclosing customer numbers but says that right now its growing at a rate of 100% each month — it’s indeed the collective experience and network that the two have that’s helping them build their platform and establish supply chains that don’t completely kill Voly on margins while still aiming to sell goods at retail, rather than marked-up, prices. Another point of distinction in how Voly is growing is that it’s choosing to make its drivers full-time employees rather than contractors. “That’s our choice,” Heath said. “Uber and DoorDash are gig economy companies. We’ve chosen a different model.”"

The financing round also included participation from existing investor, Battery Ventures, and others including M&G’s Catalyst strategy, a U.K.-based investor. UBQ Materials says it can turn landfill-destined municipal solid waste, including all organics, into recyclable plastic substitute. Its “UBQ” product can then be used both on its own and in conjunction with conventional oil-based resins in construction, automotive, logistics, retail and even 3D printing, it says.

Sound.xyz is a new startup looking to help recording artists monetize their community through NFTs, as the startup looks to build out a suite of tools designed to bring musicians into the so-called “web3” fold. The startup released is first product earlier this month, Listening Parties, which enable artists to sell NFTs tagged to the release of new songs. The startup tells TechCrunch it has raised $5 million in a seed raise led by Andreessen Horowitz. Other investors in the round include Variant Fund, Weekend Fund, Scalar Capital, Flamingo, Packy McCormick and 21 Savage, among others. The startup is looking to push emerging artists to monetize their work more effectively by leveraging NFTs and help them rise above earning minute fractions of pennies per stream on platforms like Spotify. “We’re building a suite of economic tools to help artists monetize their songs in new ways,” Sound CEO David Greenstein tells TechCrunch. “The problems that we want to solve are: Can we get music heard and can we get artists paid?” The startup has partnered with a number of “crypto-friendly” recording artists that have been engaging with the community. The early drops have been limited to a couple dozen limited-edition NFTs that have sold out instantly.  While selling $10,000 worth of NFTs may not sound too noteworthy in an industry friendly to million-dollar sales, Greenstein says the proceeds make a big difference to artists who might need hundreds of thousands of streams to earn that same amount on Spotify. As the startup gauges demand for NFT drops tied to song drops for certain artists, they have ambition to release more NFTs to the community. The startup notably does not take a commission on the sales and the NFTs. The team has been experimenting with other features for the drops like enabling NFT holders to leave comments on the streams for artists to read. Down the road, the startup wants to create broader tools that allow musicians to crowdfund from fans to create new works and tackle new projects while also creating new incentive models for curators to discover and showcase new music. Sound is not the only player in the NFT music space. Last month, a16z Crypto backed Royal, an NFT music platform looking to tokenize royalties and sell them to fans. Audius, a music-streaming platform on the blockchain, has raised over $13.5 million in funding from firms including General Catalyst and Coinbase Ventures.

2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/global-climatetech-investment-triples-but-cash-for-tech-directly-cutting-emissions-lags/","Global climate tech investment triples, but cash for tech directly cutting emissions lags","","Investment from VC and PE into climate tech is booming, reaching $87.5 bilion over H2 2020 and H1 2021, with in excess of $60 billion in the first half of 2021 alone, according to a new report from PWC. This is a 210% increase from the $28.4 billion invested in the 12 months prior; some 14 cents of every dollar of VC now going to climate tech. However, not all is rosy. The investment is mostly focused on technology solutions accounting for 20% of emissions reduction potential. So PWC says there is an opportunity to shift the focus to areas and technologies with a more direct impact on emissions. Despite this overall growth, the number of early VC, seed and Series A investments in climate tech has remained largely stagnant since 2018. Of 15 solutions analyzed, the top five, representing more than 80% of emissions reduction potential by 2050, received just 25% of the climate tech investment between 2013 and H1 2021. In other words, VC needs to put more into directly affecting emissions not just SaaS platforms, etc., which track them. Emma Cox, global climate leader, PwC U.K., said: The world has 10 years to halve global greenhouse emissions if we are to have hope of achieving net-zero by 2050 …  However, our research has found there is potential to better channel and incentivize investment in technology areas that have the greatest future emissions reduction potential. This raises the question of why these sectors are missing out — are investors missing a valuable opportunity or is there an incentive problem that needs the attention of policymakers? Climate tech encompasses technologies focused on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Climate tech investment plateaued in 2018-2020 but has rebounded in the first half of 2021 — driven by a refreshed focus on ESG in private markets, emerging regulations and standards, and more companies committing to net-zero strategies. Here are some extracts from PWC’s report: • The average climate tech deal size nearly quadrupled in H1 2021 to US$96M, from US$27M one year prior.
• About 1,600 investors were active in H1 2021, compared to fewer than 900 active investors in H1 2020 as the wider investment community becomes familiar with the opportunities in climate tech as an asset class.
• SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) were tested to further stimulate climate tech’s growth and raised US$25bn in H1 2021, accounting for more than a third of all funding.
• Mobility and Transport continues to receive the lion’s share of climate tech funding as electric vehicles (EVs), micro-mobility and other innovative transit models attract investor attention.  This challenge area raised nearlyUS$58bn between H2 2020 and H1 2021, representing two-thirds of total climate tech funding raised in the period.
• Mobility and Transport, Industry, Manufacturing and Resource management (IM&R) and Financial Services saw the fastest growth year over year between H2 2019 – H1 2021, each more than 260%, reaching US$58bn, US$6.9bn and US$1.2bn respectively.
• The top five technologies representing over 80% of future emissions reduction potential include: Solar Power, Wind Power, Food Waste Technology, Green Hydrogen Production, and Alternative Foods/Low GHG Proteins. PWC said the United States leads in climate tech investing, attracting nearly 65% of VC investment, $56.6 billion from H2 2020 to H1 2021. China is estimated to have seen $9 billion in climate tech investment in the same period, while Europe totaled $18.3 billionn, driven by a nearly 500% (494%) increase in Mobility and Transport in H2 2020 and H1 2021, compared to the prior 12 month period."

The change will allow researchers to report both bugs that could enable scraping activity, as well as previously scraped data that has already been published online. In a blog post, Meta says it believes it is the first to launch a bug bounty program to specifically target scraping activity. “We’re looking to find vulnerabilities that enable attackers to bypass scraping limitations to access data at greater scale than what we initially intended,” Security Engineering Manager Dan Gurfinkle told reports during a briefing. Data scraping is different than other “malicious” activity Meta tracks as it uses automated tools to mass-collect personal information from users’ profiles, such as email addresses, phone numbers, profile photos and other details. Even though users often willingly share this information on their public Facebook profiles, scrapers can expose these details more widely, such as publishing the information in searchable databases. It can also be difficult for Meta to combat this activity. For example, in April the personal information of more than 500 million Facebook users was published on a forum. In that case, the actual data scraping had occurred years prior, and the company had already addressed the underlying flaw. But there was little it could do once the data started circulating online. In some cases, the company has also sued individuals for data scraping. Under the new bug bounty program, researchers will be rewarded for finding “unprotected or openly public databases containing at least 100,000 unique Facebook user records with PII [personally identifiable information] or sensitive data (e.g. email, phone number, physical address, religious or political affiliation).” Instead of its usual payouts though, Meta says it will donate to a charity chosen by the researcher in order not to incentivize the publishing of scraped data. For reports of bugs that can lead to data scraping, researchers can choose between a donation or a direct payout. Meta says each bug or dataset is eligible for at least a $500 award.

In May, a version of the “gecko gripper” even found its way onto the International Space Station to test its ability to perform tasks like collecting debris and fixing satellites. In a paper published today in Science Robotics, researchers at the university are demonstrating a far more terrestrial application for the tech: picking delicate objects. It’s something that’s long been a challenge for rigid robot hands, leading to a wide range of different solutions, including soft robotic grippers. The team is showing off FarmHand, a four-fingered gripper inspired by both the dexterity of the human hand and the unique gripping capabilities of geckos. Of the latter, Stanford notes that the adhesive surface “creates a strong hold via microscopic flaps — Van der Waals force – a weak intermolecular force that results from subtle differences in the positions of electrons on the outsides of molecules.”  The team refers to the issue at hand as the “heirloom tomato problem.” Specifically, standard grippers are best suited to the repetitive task of picking up similarly sized hard objects, one after another. In tests, FarmHand has worked with bunches of grapes, uncooked eggs, basketballs and plates, among others. “You’ll see robotic hands do a power grasp and a precision grasp and then kind of imply that they can do everything in between,” said Biomimetics and Dextrous Manipulation Lab grad Wilson Ruotolo. “What we wanted to address is how to create manipulators that are both dexterous and strong at the same time.”"

Earlier this year, Instcart also enabled EBT SNAP payments across its enterprise solutions in partnership with BJ’s Wholesale Club, Brookshire’s, Food Bazaar, Food Lion, Harps Food Stores, Homeland, Publix, The Save Mart Companies, Schnucks, Strack & Van Til, Tops Markets and Wakefern Food Corp. “We’re proud of the progress we’ve made since launching EBT SNAP payments, and are grateful to our retail and USDA FNS partners for helping us bridge the food accessibility gap for millions of Americans,” said Instacart CEO Fidji Simo in a statement. “Looking ahead, we’re committed to expanding our EBT SNAP offering and investing in additional programs that offer consumers more accessible, affordable and nutritious ways to feed their families.” Instacart’s latest expansion comes as the company recently rolled out a new “Deals Tab,” which includes daily coupons from retailers and companies. It also introduced a new “Dollar Store Hub” to allow users to browse dollar store deals from more than 13,000 dollar stores, including Dollar Tree, 99 Cents Only Store, Five Below and Family Dollar. Instacart is also testing a new delivery option, which will reduce or waive the delivery fee on orders placed more than 24 hours ahead of the scheduled delivery. The new delivery option is being tested in select markets, but Instacart hasn’t specified which ones."

One of our registrants was selected in the first round in March, but none were selected in the second round in July.  We just found out another of our registrants was selected in November, however, he’s from South Africa and restricted from traveling to the U.S. due to omicron.  What should we do? Any suggestions for what to do about our other prospective hires who didn’t get selected? — Eager Employer Dear Eager, Congrats on getting two of your registrants selected in the most recent year’s H-1B lottery! Our clients had many candidates who got selected in subsequent selection rounds as well. This year’s H-1B lottery was a drawn-out process, and it’s great to see that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is committed to reaching the 85,000 H-1B cap. I touched on this in a recent podcast in which I talked about immigration changes and trends I expect to see in the year ahead. I’m anticipating that granting as many of the 85,000 H-1B visas as possible each year will continue to be a priority for the Biden administration. To reduce immigration backlogs, they are working to rebuild resources and staffing levels at USCIS and the U.S. Department of State that had been gutted during the previous four years.

If you were waiting on an EPA estimate before reserving one, wait no more. You can expect to get about 270 miles of range on a single charge from the car’s 75 kWh battery, Polestar announced on Wednesday. That puts the FWD model in the company of vehicles like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Model 3. With the entry-level models of those two cars, you can expect 249 miles and 263 miles of range, respectively. That’s not bad given the Polestar 2’s $47,200 starting price, but not nearly as good as the 303 miles of EPA-rated range Hyundai will offer with the $44,875 version of its Ioniq 5. The automaker also announced today it’s rolling out an over-the-air update for all Polestar 2 vehicles. The new software allows you to schedule when you want your car to charge, so that you can take advantage of off-peak pricing. The update also includes refinements for the car’s driver-assist systems. In the coming months, Polestar plans to release a software upgrade that will allow owners of the dual-motor Polestar 2 to unlock additional torque and horsepower from their car for a fee.

Haun joined the firm in 2018 after a career as a federal prosecutor for the Justice Department working on cyber crimes. She has been a highly visible public face for the firm’s crypto efforts, discussing the regulatory landscape of the industry at events like TechCrunch Disrupt. A spokesperson for the firm confirmed the news to TechCrunch. Andreessen Horowitz has grown to be a major presence in the crypto investment world as they’ve rapidly deployed capital into a number of startups in the space. They were an early mover with their first $300 million crypto investment fund in 2018, which they have since followed up with two larger funds, including their current vehicle, the $2.2 billion Fund III. Haun has co-led the fund alongside longtime a16z GP Chris Dixon. The firm has maintained its edge among legacy firms but is seeing increased competition among a swatch of so-called “crypto native” investment funds like Paradigm and Variant Fund. Paradigm recently closed a $2.5 billion crypto fund, the largest of its kind. Haun currently sits on the boards of Coinbase and OpenSea, among others, where she is expected to retain her board seats. Andreessen Horowitz will be a large limited partner in her fund alongside personal investments from Andreessen, Horowitz and Dixon. Haun notified her colleagues of the departure earlier today. “I will be forever grateful to Chris, Marc, and Ben for believing in me early on.

The project is the latest to emerge from Google’s in-house project incubator, Area 120, which was recently a part of a broader reorganization at the company that elevated its status after many of its earlier projects exited to different parts of Google, including its Cloud, Search, Shopping and Commerce divisions. The new project, Qaya, was co-founded by Nathaniel Naddaff-Hafrey, a founder-in-residence at Area 120 who previously worked on jobs marketplace Kormo aimed at the “next billion” internet users, specifically those in markets like India, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Qaya’s solution allows creators to build personalized web storefronts featuring their products and services, and other digital downloads, which can then be linked to their YouTube Merch Shelf, and integrated with Google Search and Google Shopping. Through these stores, creators could include things like photos, files or e-books, digital art, photo filters and presets, productivity templates, knitting patterns, fitness videos and much more. The company says up to 1,000 products can be hosted per storefront.  Image Credits: Google Each store also gets its own custom URL in the form of qaya.store/your-name or yourname.channel, which could be used in place of the links they place on social media sites created with the “link in bio” solutions available today like Linktree or Beacons. These services let creators build micro-websites pointing to their various online presences, including social media channels, shops, blogs, music or podcasts, and more. And like those services, the Qaya stores also allow creators to feature links to their other online profiles, which sit at the top of the page underneath the creator’s name and bio. But the larger purpose of the site is to connect fans directly to the content the creator has for sale, not just as a landing page to connect fans to the creator’s profile on other services. Google Pay is built into Qaya, and supports a variety of monetization types, including subscription, tipping and one-time payments. Qaya also offers insights and analytics about how the creators’ products are performing in terms of sales. Currently, the product is free to use, with monetization managed on a transactional basis. That is, creators will keep the “vast majority” of the revenue they generate from products they upload and sell on Qaya, notes Google.  Image Credits: Google   The company is now rolling out the YouTube Merch Shelf integrations for eligible YouTube creators who join Qaya’s beta and, in time, hints that Qaya aims to allow creators to sell even more products, including “other types of digital goods,” which sounds like a veiled reference to NFTs, though Google isn’t yet saying if that’s the case.  Image Credits: Google Google says the new service is launching today into beta testing in the U.S., though non-U.S. users can join a waitlist while they wait for Qaya to roll out to their country. Creators who want to gain access to Qaya’s beta can request an invitation from the Qaya website."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/ai-powered-vfx-startup-wonder-dynamics-raises-10m-a-round/","AI-powered VFX startup Wonder Dynamics raises $10M A round","","Wonder Dynamics aims to make “blockbuster-level” visual effects achievable by living-room-level creators using AI and cloud services, though it has kept its product closely under wraps. The secretive company, which boasts a star-studded set of advisors, has raised a $10 million A round ahead of a planned launch later in 2022. The company was founded by Nikola Todorovic and actor Tye Sheridan; they joined forces some years back after working on a film together and finding they shared a belief in democratizing cinema tools. Of course many tools have come down in price and difficulty, such as high-resolution cameras and the computing power to edit and color footage. But serious VFX are another matter, and the higher fidelity of today’s cameras and displays demand improved quality in CG, something that has kept the cost and barrier to entry high. Wonder Dynamics is a VFX platform that utilizes AI and cloud services to make these things easier, though exactly how is still something of a secret. “The platform uses a completely new process, and it is an end-to-end solution for content creators who lack the technical knowledge necessary to produce CG and VFX content,” explained Todorovic. “For the professional artist, the output is exportable into existing workflow and software (Unreal, Blender, Maya, etc.). It is focused on post-production, but it will drastically reduce the need for hardware, equipment and additional effort in production as it exists today.” Wonder Dynamics raises $2.5M seed to equip indie filmmakers with AI-powered VFX  We’ll know more when they debut the platform at SXSW in 2022, but until then skeptics might be comforted by the presence of Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo on its advisory board. Both are of course seasoned directors and picky about the looks of their films; Russo (and his brother Anthony Russo) in particular is known for preferring practical effects to CG where the latter is not absolutely required, so his support is notable. “As we got deeper into our development we knew that this could be more than just software for Visual Effects,” said Sheridan in a press release. “Our platform can be used for film and TV, but also video games, social media content, and even the Metaverse.” The latter provides additional justification for two of the new investors, Epic Games and Samsung Next. Horizon Ventures led the $10 million round, with seed round investors Founders Fund and MaC Venture Capital returning as well."

Know your bag is in the house somewhere but just can’t find it? Tap a button, make it beep. And, well, these things are quite good! I bought four expecting to not find a use for all of them, then pretty much immediately went back and bought four more. I put one in my wallet, one in my pool bag, one in my favorite jacket so I never lose it at a party, one in my car because I’m bad at parking lots and more. The battery lasts a long time and is easily replaceable. One catch: They really only work with iOS devices, so consider alternatives for Android users. Price: one for $30 or four for $99  Image Credits: Brian Heater Apple didn’t invent the concept of fully wireless headphones with the AirPods — but they definitely helped to explode the category. Lots of competition has since hit the market, much of it worth checking out. Our own Brian Heater checked out Nothing’s $99 Ear (1) buds (pictured above) and found them to be “solid”; Jabra’s Elite 3 in-ear wireless buds, meanwhile, are basic (don’t expect much in the way of noise cancellation) but good. If they specifically asked for AirPods, you’re gonna have to jump back a generation to get’em for under $100. Gen 2 AirPods are still quite good, but compared to Gen 3 they’ve got a different design, weaker battery life, no water resistance and a few other key differences. Price: Nothing’s Ear (1), $99 | Jabra Elite 3, $80 on Amazon  Image Credits: Philips I started tinkering with Philips Hue smart bulbs a few years ago, and they’re slowly taking over my house. They’re a dead simple and relatively affordable way to make any room feel way fancier, allowing you to tweak the lighting (brightness, color, temperature, etc.) in an instant with your phone or, if you’ve got smart speakers around your house, your voice. I’ve got a dozen of them around my house now and they’ve been absolutely rock solid for years. Want more smart home gift ideas? Check out our smart home starter guide here. Price: Three for $90 on Amazon  Image Credits: Amazon There are a zillion e-book readers out there … but, for most people, and as much as it pains me, it’s hard to recommend anything over a Kindle. They’re well built, polished and the process of getting a book onto it is about as simple as could be. If you’re trying to stay under $100, the $75 base model Kindle will get the job done. You won’t get the waterproofing or much brighter LEDs of the $140 Kindle Paperwhite or the $250 Kindle Oasis … but if what you want is a device that’ll let you carry around a zillion books at once with a battery that lasts days/weeks, the base model checks all the boxes. Plus, if ads on the home screen don’t seem like a big deal, they’ll cut the price down to $55.

Price: $100 from Artiphone  Image Credits: Anker The charging cables that come with most phones aren’t great. They’re too quick to fall apart, and way too short — especially if you like to look at your phone in bed. Is looking at your phone in bed a good idea? Nope! Do we all do it anyway? Yep! Anker’s woven cables are a huge step up. They’re nice and long (6-10 ft), come in lightning or USB-C forms, and the woven nylon cable lasts way longer, in my experience, than the quick-to-fray plastic of the included cables. I keep a few of these around as stocking stuffers and back up gifts. Price: Lightning cable, $20 for 2 from Amazon | USB-C cable, $16 for 2 from Amazon  Image Credits: Anker Speaking of Anker, I’m a big fan of their PowerCore Fusion backup battery. It’s not the highest-capacity backup battery by any means, but it’s got a neat trick: It’s a wall charger and a backup battery, all-in-one. It’ll charge your phone first, then charge its own internal 10,000 mAh battery — so, assuming you use it as your regular charger, you’ll never reach for your backup battery to find that it, too, is dead. This thing has earned a forever spot in my travel bag and has saved my butt multiple times. Price: $50 from Amazon  Image Credits: Google I friggin’ love streaming sticks. They’re ridiculously affordable for all the services they can push to your TV (Netflix! Hulu! Paramount+! Disney+! HBO Max!) and are almost always far far better than the apps built into most smart TVs. I like the Chromecast a lot — both the standard $30 Chromecast and the $40 Chromecast with Google TV — because I primarily control my TV through apps on my phone. If you want 4K support, Apple TV+ support, or a remote control, go with the latter option. Alternatively, Amazon’s Firestick range and Roku’s streaming sticks are all quite good.

I put one in my kitchen a year or so back and now use it almost every time I cook — for asking Google “what temperature is medium rare?” for the 37th time, starting timers without touching anything or for playing something from Hulu (read: “Bob’s Burgers.” Always “Bob’s Burgers”) when making a recipe I’ve made a million times before. Plus it’s on sale right now. Price: $60 from Google, usually $100  Image Credits: JBL I’ve been driving way less since the pandemic started. No commute/less socializing will do that. The unexpected side effect? My podcast listening time plummeted. Turns out I really only listened to podcasts in the car or on the bus. A few months back, though, I started listening to podcasts in the shower with one of these simple-but-solid JBL GO 2 waterproof speakers, and I love it. It takes me like four showers to get through an episode I used to listen to in one commute, but hey — I’m back to listening! I tend to just throw this speaker in my bag and take it with me wherever; something I can’t say of the many, many Bluetooth speakers I’ve owned before it. It’s small, feels indestructible, the battery life is good enough that I don’t really worry about it and it’s loud enough to provide tunes at a picnic without annoying everyone else at the park. Price: $40 from Amazon  Image Credits: Backbone This thing turns the iPhone into a proper gaming device, and it feels way nicer than I’d have guessed from the price tag. Expand controller, drop iPhone in, play. It’s my go-to device for Apple Arcade games (I’ve played way, way too much Sneaky Sasquatch with this thing) or for streaming PlayStation/Xbox games to my phone when I’m in another room.

2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/us-investment-in-smart-roadways-will-pave-the-path-to-an-economic-boom/","US investment in smart roadways will pave the path to an economic boom","","The challenges facing the U.S. transportation system are plentiful and worsen each year. As demand on our nation’s roadways increases, so do safety, efficiency and sustainability issues. The historic $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, one of the largest and wide-reaching infrastructure packages in decades, is a massive down payment on the investment needs of the nation and will unlock thousands of important projects in every state. But public funds alone, especially when allocated over a period of five years, are insufficient to keep pace with the emerging needs of our population, cities and the vehicles that travel the roads every day. For example, the plan allocates $100 billion for repairing aging and dilapidated highways, bridges and roads. Unfortunately, the U.S. has underfunded its roadways for years, leaving 43% of our public roadways in poor or mediocre condition and resulting in a backlog of $435 billion in road repair needs. Even with public funds dedicated to repairing our roads, we’re still behind where we need to be. The transportation infrastructure industry has historically been risk-averse and limited by the availability of public transportation funds. However, there are several historic examples of early technology networks that we all rely on to this day that have had dramatic impacts on the national economy. These projects were spurred by public investment, required local implementation by local public works agencies, and were largely delivered and maintained by private organizations. Paved roads were introduced a little more than 100 years ago to support the early automobile. The interstate system has been known as the “greatest public works project in history” since President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. It’s a means of everyday travel, commerce and culture. You wouldn’t be reading this article on a computer, tablet or smartphone screen without the benefits afforded by the national power grid, cable and cell networks. As we rely upon, trust and relinquish more of our lives to technology, a growing number of transportation researchers and smart infrastructure providers are embracing creative new methods of improving safety, efficiency and sustainability. There are more than 4 million miles of public roadways crisscrossing the United States. Smart roads are an obvious, accessible solution to transform infrastructure for the next generation of vehicles, people and cities. Too often we invent new technology to improve old technology. Transforming roads into networks is a solution that enables technology. By transforming roads into a data and communications platform, we can collect anonymous data brick-and-mortar stores can use to have the same level of insight for vehicle traffic as online retailers get from internet traffic. Online retailers are informed about their customers’ demographics, shopping and buying habits, market trends and traffic patterns because traffic data is automatically and passively collected because of internet infrastructure and services. Comparatively, brick-and-mortar stores essentially know nothing about their customer base. The entrepreneur invests millions into the local economy after spending months finding and fitting out a location, stocking and staffing it, all before a single transaction can be made. The anonymous data collected from roadways can help business owners improve their operations and enable traditional retailers to remain competitive with online retailers. If we leverage these smart infrastructure services, roads can pay for themselves by relying on the cash flow from these new capabilities — much like cell and internet infrastructure markets have been mostly self-supporting. This means some public roads can be sustainably financed and self-funding, which allows cities to shift their limited budgets away from roads and toward other community needs. The infrastructure plan’s $65 billion for broadband access would aim to improve internet services for rural areas, low-income families and tribal communities. The plan’s $7.5 billion allocated for electric vehicle charging stations aims to accelerate electric vehicle adoption to help curb climate change and reduce the nation’s dependence on oil. If smart roads offered a menu of capabilities, including 5G wireless access and wireless EV charging, designed from the outset to be software-upgradeable, our nation’s road networks would be able to keep pace with evolving technology. Roads are already available in rural areas, so there’s no need to construct new cell towers. Embedding the roads with wireless EV charging capabilities would eliminate the need for charging stations to follow a gas station model — in fact, EV owners and drivers wouldn’t have to pull off the road and plug in to charge at all. Assessing fees for the use of the commercial services delivered via these roadways — whether for communication services paid for by network operators, EV charging and navigation paid for by the vehicle owners, or data services paid for by the businesses that use them — enable smart roads to pay for themselves by relying on the cash flow from these new capabilities. The main challenge to the adoption of smart roads is that public owners have gotten into the mindset that they cannot, and should not, take risks with public money. Historically, public money is risk capital and the first money in on these opportunities. We must get public owners out of this risk-free mindset and battle the idea that public agencies cannot or should not enable economic development through infrastructure. Putting public investment into infrastructure opportunities that enable massive economic development is how we got paved roads 100 years ago and interstates 60 years ago. Therefore, it’s an approach that’s already been vetted and with some notable proof points that Americans are using every day. These aren’t new ways of doing things. These are old ways of doing things we’ve done many times, packaged in an updated way for the emerging needs of society. Another challenge is how prolonged public projects are compared to market activities. In the 18 months it takes a public agency to issue a road work permit, we can see an entire generation of software and hardware pass by but not a single shovel has hit the ground. The slow pace of public works means we must look far, far ahead. We can’t focus on short-term goals because those will be gone before the project leaves the design stage. Public works’ scope, scale and speed (or lack thereof) means we must take an extremely long time horizon. Investing in our nation’s roadways is key to growing a thriving economy and critical to our future. Today, cities face pressure to respond to urbanization, streamline traffic flow, reduce pollution and help improve safety. Smart road technology helps city planners and governments address these challenges head-on. From traffic management to pedestrian and vehicle safety to environmental monitoring, the Internet of Things (IoT) is making roadways more intelligent, efficient and well managed. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a first step to help tackle the current state of our nation’s infrastructure. How this investment is used will be the change-maker. If it is distributed to apply Band-Aid solutions on aging processes simply because it’s how things have been done in recent years, then the money will go fast and soon be forgotten without any meaningful improvements. But suppose we use this investment as a down payment on innovative infrastructure projects. In that case, we have an opportunity to build the proper cadence of consistent and meaningful upgrades that progress toward a stronger future and allow emerging technologies to be integrated easier and at a faster rate."

At the core of SQream’s service is its GPU-centric “data acceleration platform,” which promises to speed up SQL queries and enable users to run their queries on more data. Panoply, on the other hand, offers its users a no-code data integration platform with support for over 300 different sources, which its users can then query in their favorite BI and analytics tools, or analyze using SQL queries in Panoply itself. In addition, Panoply also helps its users automate their data warehouse configurations. As such, it looks like the two platforms are quite complementary, with Panoply providing SQream with the tools and expertise to expand its platform to a wider user base. “This is a significant step towards implementing SQream’s vision to provide our customers with the fastest data analytics platform in the industry, at any scale of data for multi-size enterprises, and in any environment — cloud, on prem and on the edge,” said SQream co-founder and CEO Ami Gal. “With Panoply’s acquisition, we are combining SQream’s GPU-powered, cutting-edge technology with Panoply’s phenomenal ease of use and seamless integration and onboarding. This is a huge milestone on our journey to provide the world with the new category of analytics platform that is ready for tomorrow’s data challenges.” Panoply raised $24 million in outside capital since its inception in 2015. Investors include the likes of Ibex Investors and C5 Captial, which led the company’s $10 million round in 2020, as well as Blumberg Capital, 500 Startups, FundersGuild and Intel Capital. The two companies did not disclose the price of today’s acquisition. Panoply will continue to operate as a separate business unit, but as Panoply co-founder and CEO Yaniv Leven notes in today’s announcement, the acquisition means that the 160+ strong team will now have access to additional resources and expertise. SQream says it has “ambition growth plans” for the service in order to meet demand for the platform’s services. “Since our inception, we’ve taken a different approach to cloud analytics,” Leven said. “We’ve made it our mission to transform the focus of cloud architecture from data-centric to information-centric, by focusing on the insights you can gain from your data, rather than just the technical process of moving and storing it. SQream’s focus on driving fast data insights echoes this mission. The synergy between SQream and Panoply holds great promise for data practitioners as it expands Panoply’s reach to a wider audience and provides Panoply’s advantages of automation, no-code and simplicity to larger and larger organizations.” Panoply.io Raises $1.3M Seed Round For Its Data Warehousing Platform  Panoply raises $10M for its cloud data platform "

Olist said it tripled its size in 2021 and closed on four acquisitions within the last year, including social commerce startup Clickspace, logistics company PAX, and VNDA and Tiny ERP, both offering commerce tools for small businesses. “With more than 45,000 shopkeepers and retailers as clients, Olist has always been at the forefront of digital retail, long before the e-commerce hype that helped drive the search for our solutions,” said Tiago Dalvi, founder and CEO of Olist, in a written statement. “With this new round, we want to go beyond what we do today and deliver more and more value to our customers.” In fact, the company wants to go beyond marketplaces, and the new capital will enable it to offer a fulfillment operation, set to open early next year, as well as financial services. Retailers on Olist already have access to credit lines for working capital, but the company plans to expand that technology to include risk management, accelerated sales and internal credit models for merchants. Meanwhile, the company recently began operations in Mexico and intends to expand its footprint across Latin America next year. Update, 12/15 at 10:50 a.m. PST: Olist errored in saying Wellington’s investment was its first contribution to a private company in Latin America.

2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/prellis-biologics-raises-14-5m-debuts-a-human-immune-system-in-a-dish/","Prellis Biologics raises $14.5M, debuts a ‘human immune system’ in a dish","","Prellis Biologics, a company developing the tools to create 3D-printed organs, announced a $14.5 million Series B round on Wednesday. Prellis has spent years developing tissue engineering capacity, but has focused recently on developing one type of structure in particular. Up until this point, Prellis has focused on 3D printing vascular scaffolds that would allow companies to grow healthy and oxygenated human organs (or miniature versions, called organoids) for drug testing, and eventually transplant. But the company has recently debuted a new product, called EXIS (short for Externalized Immune System): a lab-grown version of a human lymph node.  Lymph nodes are critical parts of the human immune system — they store certain immune cells, and help the body manufacture immune responses. Ideally, those lymph node organoids would aid in drug development by mimicking how a person’s immune system might respond to new treatment. And, perhaps, help create some new drugs along the way.  “By creating this immune system in a dish, we can actually test if those therapeutics are going to elicit an immune response before it goes into a human,” founder and CEO Melanie Matheu told TechCrunch.  “Our company’s edge is that [EXIS] is out of the box fully human.”  Prellis Biologics, founded in 2016, has raised about $29.5 million to date. This Series B round was led by Celesta Capital and existing investor Khosla Ventures, with participation from SOSV IndieBio. In addition, the company will add Kevin Chapman, Celesta advisor and former CSO of Berkeley Lights, as chief scientific officer. Yelda Kaya, formerly of J&J Innovation, will join as chief business officer.  Lymph node responses to drugs or pathogens has been recognized as a way to predict how the whole immune system might react. Correspondingly, there are a number of academic labs working on developing in-vitro models of human lymph nodes — from lymph nodes on chips to growing lymphoid organoids from tonsil tissue.  This focus on the lymph node, in turn, opens up a new angle for the company: antibody drug development. Developing new antibody treatments and predicting how they’ll work in clinical tests is becoming a more competitive space, and there are a few different approaches underway. Some are computational. Nabla Bio, which just raised $11 million, has used natural language processing to design antibodies. Generate Bio, which just raised a $370 million Series B, has also used a machine learning approach.  Prellis’ approach is to model the immune system in miniature and develop a cadre of drug candidates by mining immune responses. Matheu calls it “natural intelligence” as opposed to artificial intelligence.  The company can create 1,200 organoids from one blood draw, challenge those immune systems with a particular antigen, and see what each immune system comes up with. That process, she says, can be done with different blood donors with different immune system characteristics to create a plethora of responses to analyze.  “It’s very rare that all 10 of those people are going to come up with the same antibody solution to the problem of: does it bind this protein? And so from a given human, we’re averaging anywhere from 500 to 2,000 unique antibodies, and then you just multiply that by the number of people, and these are all target binding antibodies.”  It takes about 18 days to go from blood draw to “antibody library,” per materials provided by Prellis Biologics.   Image Credits: Prellis Biologics Matheu says the company has developed antibodies responsive to SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever (these results haven’t been published). The company is developing partnerships with five drug companies, though Matheu declined to name which ones.  The company plans to use this round to move from an R&D driven company to a product focused one — which means developing more drug partnerships, and demonstrating the platform’s capability.  The major marker of success, she says, would be to bring an antibody treatment into the clinic. That may occur through collaboration with a pharmaceutical partner, though the company hasn’t ruled out creating a drug pipeline of its own.  Matheu is light on specifics, but says Prellis is developing “internal technology” that would support a therapeutic pipeline.  “I will say, we will move in that direction as the technology develops,” she said.    *This story has been updated to reflect that Prellis is developing partnerships with drug companies, but has not yet entered into them and to include mention of investor SOSV IndieBio."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/nucleus-genomics-announces-3-5m-seed-round-for-a-fresh-take-on-genetic-tests/","Nucleus Genomics announces $3.5M seed round for a fresh take on genetic tests","Regulatory paths","When COVID-19 closed down most of society in 2020, Kian Sadeghi, like many of his then-classmates at the University of Pennsylvania, found himself holed up in his bedroom. He prefers it that way.  During those months at home in Brooklyn, Sadeghi filled eight spiral notebooks with research on genetic sequencing, computer science and statistics. The result was the formation of Nucleus Genomics (still listed as a “stealth” startup on his LinkedIn, as of writing), which he has dropped out of Penn to pursue full time.  Nucleus’ Genomics pitch, per Sadeghi, provides a fresher take on genomic analysis. Users can upload their genetic information obtained through an established company, like 23andMe or Ancestry, or order a genetic testing kit. Then the company’s “proprietary algorithms” will calculate polygenic risk scores – measure of disease risk based on analysis of genetic variants – and display them in a user-friendly platform.  “The thesis is a human genome on every iPhone,” Sadeghi told TechCrunch. “So we combine genetic and non-genetic information to eventually calculate the absolute risk scores for people for disease.”  Nucleus announced a $3.5 million seed round on Tuesday led by Founders Fund. The round includes participation from Adrian Aoun (CEO at Forward Health), Patrick Hsu (Professor at UC Berkeley and co-inventor of CRISPR), Brent Saunders (former CEO at Allergan), Matteo Franceschetti (CEO at Eight Sleep), Joshua Browder (CEO, DoNotPay), Cory Levy, Adam Guild, Pareto Holdings, Pomp, Shrug, Ankur Nagpal, Quiet Capital, Salt Fund, Bluewatch Ventures, Night, and Brandon White.  The background behind Nucleus Genomics is the idea that people will be eager to know more about their genomes. And that they’ll want to learn how to actually interpret that information.  Sadeghi clearly has this interest himself. He traces the ideological origin of his company to the premature death of a cousin from long QT syndrome, which in some cases, is genetically linked. He then started to experiment with genes on his own at Brooklyn-based Genspace, a community biology lab. (He was featured in a Wall Street Journal story on DIY CRISPR enthusiasts). Sadeghi’s interest in genetics is shared by others. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing initially spawned a subculture of people who have uploaded their genetic information to services like GEDMatch, which has been used to help people find lost relatives, or under controversial circumstances, solve cold cases.  But direct-to-consumer genetic testing has truly exploded in recent years. In 2013 fewer than 2 million people ordered consumer genetic tests. By 2018, it was north of 12 million. By 2021, Bloomberg reported that one in five Americans has turned over their genetic data to either 23andMe or a competitor.  There could be more fuel left to burn in this fire. One 2018 poll run by the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research suggested as much as 54 percent of Americans had still heard little or nothing about genetic testing.  Sadeghi’s pitch is many of those who have yet to embrace genetic testing are younger people. There’s some evidence to back this up, though not a huge amount. A 2017 survey of about 1,600 DTC genetic test consumers (from 23andMe and Pathway), found that the average user was middle aged, white, and, most likely, a college educated female.  The average age of a 23andMe user, per the company’s 2011 numbers, is 45. TechCrunch has reached out to 23andMe to confirm the age of their user base, but has not heard back.  Nucleus, he says, will aim to boil down genetic testing into user-friendly reports that will be distributed through “newfound distribution channels” – an effort to reach younger audiences.  “We can tap into a brand-new audience and introduce an entire generation to genetic testing, just as you could say Robinhood introduced an entire generation to the stock market,” he said.  Nucleus, though, won’t necessarily rely on new users. It also aims to become a third-party platform, where people could upload their genomic data collected by other companies. There are already third-party platforms like impute.me (a nonprofit), and Allelica (raised 1.75 million in a recent seed round) that provides detailed information on clinical disease risk if users upload genetic information.  Within that landscape, Nucleus does offer a good incentive to upload: cash for the user.  Nucleus will also be open to sharing genetic information with drug companies, says Sadeghi, if users opt-in to sharing their information. Should they choose to share genetic information through Nucleus they can earn a potential “dividend payment.”  Consumer data is already being shared anyway. 23andMe has struck a deal with GSK to use genetic information for drug identification and research – only data from users who opt-in to this service is shared. (23andMe and GSK already have a cancer drug in clinical trials.) In exchange for the genetic data they provide, which increasingly could be used to develop money-making drugs and other medical products, users get their own payout.  As of now, the amount of that dividend payment is undecided, says Sadeghi.  In 2013, 23andMe first debuted reports using genetics to predict health risk. But FDA asked the company to pump the brakes and issued a warning letter. Since then, the company has received FDA approval for a number of genetic tests that quantify health risks for conditions like Parkinson’s or breast cancer, to name a few. A diabetes risk calculation test was debuted in 2019, but didn’t go through FDA approval because it was called a “wellness product”– sparking some criticism over its utility.   23andMe essentially hammered out the process of getting DTC tests and reports approved. And that has opened up the possibility of obtaining 510(k) premarket clearance for other genetic analysis algorithms, should they show equivalent accuracy. (23andMe was concerned about this exact process, and disclosed it as a risk factor in S-1 filings).  Right now, Nucleus is still developing its polygenic risk score algorithms. Those are the company’s secret sauce.  “It’s extremely technical, extremely hard, extremely cutting edge,” Sadeghi said. But as for regulatory strategy, the company initially plans to go a route once used by Ancestry – order tests from a clinical network, rather than creating their own.  That does allow the company to sidestep FDA approval of its algorithms at first (this process is regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid). But perhaps not for long. Eventually Ancestry pivoted and applied for 510(k) market approval for its own DNA testing kit and genetic test.  When TechCrunch pointed this out in a followup email: Sadeghi said: “Eventually, in the future, we do seek to go that route.” In the meantime, the company plans to launch sometime around January 2022 and has plans to grow the team from three to six or seven members.  “It’s an imminent inevitability that every person has the human genome sequence,” said Sadeghi. “The question is who is actually going to respond to collect that data? I’m hoping that it’s going to be Nucleus.”"
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/proov-raises-9-7m-series-a-for-at-home-ovulation-testing-platform/","Proov raises $9.7M Series A for at-home ovulation testing platform","","MFB Fertility, the creator of a suite of at-home pregnancy-related hormone tests, announced a $9.7 million Series A round this week. The round follows several milestones for the company, including an FDA premarket approval for a progesterone urine test and the rollout of a mobile app. It also gives the company more fodder to build toward its thesis: that at-home hormone testing can save both time and stress related to “unexplained” infertility.  MFB Fertility is more commonly known as Proov — the name of the test developed by owner and CEO Amy Beckley. Proov was founded in 2018, after Beckley had her own struggles with infertility and miscarriage. She found herself classified as “unexplained infertile.”  In Beckley’s case, a prescription solved her problem. But the Proov tests, she says, were created for women who also find themselves in the “unexplained” category of infertility diagnoses. Studies have estimated that somewhere between 15-30% of infertility diagnoses worldwide fall into that unexplained category.  “It’s just a copout,” Beckley told TechCrunch. “For a woman to go in and get all the tests and then come out on the other end, and it’s like, oh, yeah, you know, you’re unexplained infertile.”  This round was led by Hambrecht Ducera Growth Ventures. It includes participation from SteelSky Ventures, WCC Partners, Lightship Capital, GingerBread Capital and Portfolia FemTech II Fund.  Unexplained infertility can come down to any number of male or female factors. Proov’s flagship test is designed to rule out two problems: the status of ovulation — the process by which an egg is matured and released, and the readiness of the uterus.  If you go to a doctor’s office, that doctor might perform a blood test for progesterone, a hormone that helps ready the uterus for pregnancy, and spikes after an egg is released. Proov has developed an at-home urine test to measure a metabolite of progesterone, PdG.   External research has validated PdG as a marker of ovulation. One 2017 review paper notes that measuring urine PdG levels over three days was accurate when it came to confirming ovulation, but that no point of care tests using this method had been developed yet.  “We developed the first and only FDA-cleared way to measure this at home through urine to understand what we call ovulation quality: Is the uterus optimally prepared to have the highest chance of conception?” said Beckley. “We invented it. I literally was the first person to ever have this technology.” Proov has gone through the process of getting the PdG test evaluated and approved by the FDA. It received 510(k) clearance in February 2020, because its results were substantially similar to progesterone tests (not direct to consumer) that already exist.  Proov’s own clinical trials have suggested that progesterone (and PdG) can also be useful markers of other pregnancy outcomes. The data has yet to be published, but Proov reported data from one trial on 54 pregnant women suggesting that women who had two days or more of negative PdG tests during a critical window of time saw increased rates of miscarriage.  That data is reported in a change.org petition run by the company. The petition is in response to American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines suggesting progesterone therapy only be given to women who have already had miscarriages (the company argues that certain tests could also used as impetus for progesterone therapy). PdG tests, though, aren’t the only thing Proov has been up to. The company’s newest product is a “complete” testing product that will provide tests for PdG, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and an estrogen marker. And, it’s rolled out a mobile app to help users interpret those tests.  The app itself is an entry point for more detailed information. Users can submit photos of multiple test strips, which then yield numerical scores detailing certain hormone levels. Those scores are produced via “machine-learning and back-end algorithms,” says Beckley.  At the end of the month, the app will provide an ovulation score, says Beckley. Though, critically, the app does more than just provide a number.  Offering a test or even a score on its own, she said, led to frustration with users. “Literally, they were writing on our Facebook: ‘I hate this, because I don’t know what to do with a negative result,” Beckley explained.   In response the app allows patients to share their results with doctors, speak with experts and also receive certain lifestyle tips through the app (like exercise or nutrition) that might go on to improve progesterone levels. The company is also currently building a supplement platform that would be integrated with the app.  The takeaway, per Beckley, is that testing alone isn’t enough.  “You have to take that information and gently give her that, but also give her solutions at the same time,” she said.  There are a few general trends playing in Proov’s favor. First is the rise of at-home medical testing.  Major diagnostics companies have already announced intent to expand from at-home COVID tests into other arenas. Quest Labs estimates that at-home consumer testing will become a $2 billion industry by 2025. Robert Ford, CEO Of Abbott Labs, for example has also suggested that at-home COVID tests are “seeding” the idea of at-home tests all over the country. If you’re getting used to taking at-home COVID tests, maybe you’ll become accustomed to at-home testing in general. Beckley too has noticed diagnostic company interest in Proov as well. “It’s a lot of the bigger kind of diagnostic companies that are the most interested in what we’re doing,” she said. “Their market is doctors, hospital systems, payers. They don’t understand consumers and what’s buying behavior, so they’re leaning into direct-to-consumer companies like us, that market directly to women.”  Fertility testing too — for both men and women — has proved to be an especially active area for startups and investors since about 2019. Crunchbase’s numbers reported an 89% increase in funding for fertility startups between 2020 and 2021, suggesting that the trend is still going strong. "
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/kalendar-ai-pre-seed/","Kalendar AI wants its sales bots to win your next customers","","Kalendar AI, a San Francisco-based startup that’s been building on top of GPT-3‘s language model — developing a SaaS for automating lead generation and sales outreach to make it easier for companies to get initial meetings with prospective customers — has raised $3.2 million in pre-seed funding from 500 Startups; “The Lean Startup” author, Eric Ries; VC firms Village Global and Metaplanet; and 20+ angel investors (including CEOs of “popular” but undisclosed companies). “Our AI technology writes personalized invitations to ideal customers with personalized decks — inviting them to take a meeting,” explains founder and CEO Ravi Vadrevu. The SaaS was launched in February this year, although the startup itself — which is called Kriya Inc — was founded back in 2017 and had been bootstrapping prior to raising this pre-seed. The idea for the B2B product is to automate the time-consuming and expensive process of sales outreach, including locating and pitching leads, as well as to offer tools to streamline and enhance initial sales meetings. Kalendar AI claims to have amassed a database of more than 340 million “ideal customer profiles” upon which it unleashes its AI sales rep bots to send “personalized” pitches (including “interactive presentations that convert into one-click meetings”) to likely looking customers. “Our solution brings down the time to initiate a conversation to book an appointment from seven days to 30 seconds from a sales perspective,” claims Vadrevu, who also argues there are big productivity wins from a marketing perspective versus other channels. So where is Kalendar AI getting data on all those hundreds of millions of potential customers? “We have our own data sets that we built over years from publicly available information,” he tells TechCrunch, specifying that it uses Common Crawl, an open source repository of the internet, to collect “publicly available metadata information” and “form an index for searching”. “We get all the available B2B company domains and the people associated to those domains (this information updates every quarter),” he goes on, adding: “We only engage people on their business email, and don’t store any personal information. We disclaim this in the footer of every interaction that our technology predicted their business email in real-time using machine learning patterns.” For “content narratives”, Vadrevu says the AI relies upon “real-time data services” such as the latest company news, company descriptions, current weather/events around a location, industry news, etc. “We plan to increase such contexts by investing in content R&D,” he further notes. Asked if it’s using any data scraped from LinkedIn, Vadrevu claims not — arguing: “We don’t need LinkedIn profiles as we process names and predict emails from publicly available domain/company metadata in real time. LinkedIn is a personal network, and most business interactions usually happen, and more effective on a business email.” Scraping LinkedIn is “not only unethical but it’s also unnecessary”, he adds when pressed for a confirmation that Kalendar AI does not scrape the Microsoft-owned professional social network to enrich its database. The SaaS is “nearing” its first 100 customers at this stage, per Vadrevu, who says the best markets for the product so far are technology, marketing & advertising, IT & Infrastructure. “We have customers ranging from a small team of five people to public companies like Upwork. However, most of our customers are digital media companies, startups and new growth entrepreneurs building businesses on top of our platform,” he adds. “We’ve reached $1 million in ARR revenue in the last three months, consistently maintaining a 60% month-over-month growth,” he also tells us, specifying that the new funding will mostly go toward building out the engineering team and improving the product. “Currently [we’re] focused on forming an engineering growth team responsible for optimizing our algorithms to ensure the engagement is pleasant, effective and efficient for all of our customers and the recipients.” Now, it doesn’t require a ghost in the machine to tell you that while AI can be a powerful productivity tool it can also be terribly hit-and-miss. Here are a few ways GPT-3 can go wrong  And even if the claimed “personalization” of sales pitches is spot on target, receiving an automated sales pitching might risk a potential customer feeling, well, roundly unimpressed at the robotic cold call. Or — to put it another way — like they just got spammed. So a pitch-by-robot might be all too easy to ignore. “It’s a very hard problem and we don’t please everyone yet,” admits Vadrevu. “We have a 2% error rate that sometimes creates unpleasant experiences where we created channels for people to directly give us feedback and let them opt-out of our platform. “What surprises us by being transparent is that more people are considerate about helping businesses than we thought.” “If we become successful, the beauty of AI eventually empowers businesses and individuals connecting in many ways beyond sales like how we call connect today,” he adds. “We’re still very early and are grateful for our investors who’re supporting us.” The startup’s ultimate goal for is the product is to be able to provide a fully end-to-end SaaS for sales outreach and meetings (including videoconferencing and CRM), not just fancy personalized pitches that its AI sales bots fire out at inhuman speeds. “Our vision is to build an ecosystem around the appointments we set, including video conferencing, CRM, etc., to improve the quality of the meetings,” he says. “The immediate impact of such technology is on sales (revenue autopilot), which otherwise involves heavy marketing & sales processes to achieve. The adjacent markets for such a technology could also be recruiting, job search, etc., which is not our focus,” Vadrevu also suggests. The startup’s own sales pitch for its SaaS is that it can radically reduce the time and cost of booking “a high quality meeting that directly impacts revenue“.  But of course the B2B product is certainly not free. A “basic plan” starts at $2,000/m for 20 “AI authors” (booking an estimated range of 20 meetings per month; since its fee is pay-per-meeting), according to Vadrevu. While a “Scale plan” starts at $4,000/m for 50 AI authors (booking an estimated range of 40 meetings pm). Vadrevu argues this pricing puts the product “on the cheaper side” versus other tools companies would be using to try to lock in leads, suggesting B2B companies’ customer acquisition costs for a single meeting range from $150 to $2,000 (i.e. “using Google SEM, digital marketing, sales tools, etc. to get the same ROI”). “We’re making it cheap for our customers by bundling meetings into SaaS,” he further argues. “At scale, we might get into a price per meeting prediction but we saw that SaaS is ideal for our customers.” On the competitive front, Vadrevu claims Kalendar AI is breaking new ground — and that “no one else is doing what we are doing until now as it’s incredibly hard” — emphasizing that development covers product iterations on content personalization with real-time feedback loops; AI-powered matching that needs to be adequately accurate, safe and not (so) spammy; as well as compliance with variable data regulations — hence why it took the startup three years to push the button on a market launch. But pressed to name some startup competition, he says that for the personalized outbound messaging component there are AI copywriting tools such as Copy.ai; while for inbound decks he suggests it’s competing with scheduling pages such as Chili Piper, Calendly and “any other inbound marketing funnel tools”.  Still, Kalendar AI’s wider pitch is that it’s going further by using AI to join up a bunch of manual sales and marketing work. “Currently for B2B companies, there’s marketing and sales working separately to book appointments. But it takes a lot of manual effort to reach a consistent number of meetings every month on autopilot,” he adds. “Our approach leverages personalized sales outreach, coupled with interactive inbound (decks with one-click meetings; we might patent it) bringing down the cost and time to book a high-quality meeting that directly impacts revenue.” Unique closes $6M seed for its AI-driven video calls platform aimed at sales teams  Flowrite is an AI writing productivity tool that wants to help you hit inbox zero   "

Other companies have tried to build a business on exchanging dead batteries for fresh ones to solve the problem of long EV charge times: Fourteen years ago, Better Place raised nearly a billion dollars to do what Ample’s doing, and it ended up declaring bankruptcy. But that was more than a decade ago, when EVs weren’t sufficiently advanced —or plentiful — to make the business model work. That didn’t deter Ample co-founder John de Souza. Born and raised in Ethiopia to a Greek/Ethiopian mother and a Portuguese/Indian father who found ways to send him and his siblings to school despite their poverty, his family relocated to Dubai when the Ethiopian Civil War started in the 1970s. After emigrating, de Souza finished out high school before heading to the United States at 16 to attend university under a full scholarship. Since then, he has founded multiple companies, including fintech company Smartleaf, internet startup Flash Communications and consumer health platform MedHelp, where his current co-founder, Khaled Hassounah, served as CTO. Both de Souza and Hassounah come from immigrant backgrounds, which de Souza said affords them with that creative entrepreneurial mentality. Neither co-founder had previous experience in the energy sector, but by 2018, both co-founders saw an opportunity in the EV market. The only problem was that it would be difficult to get people to convert to EVs when the technology, at least from a refueling UX perspective, was much worse than the status quo. Many investors didn’t last five minutes into an Ample pitch because they could still see the smoldering ruins of Better Place, but de Souza and Hassounah raised upward of $275 million to solve for the limitations of plug-in charging. Today, Ample has partnered with Sally, an EV rental company that offers ride-hailing, taxi and last-mile deliveries, along with Uber and Eneos, a Japanese petroleum and energy company. The company’s path to market relies on contracts with fleets wherein Ample’s battery chemistry-agnostic modular battery packs can be swapped into and out of any vehicle. Ample already has deployed seven swapping stations in the Bay Area for participating Uber drivers and plans to launch in Europe, starting with Madrid next year. Depending on COVID-19 border restrictions, Ample is also targeting late next year to start building stations in Japan. The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. You have a track record of founding quite a few companies that span communications, fintech, health tech and now EV battery swapping. A couple of your companies did end up being acquired, so are you planning on sticking it out with Ample? Or are you already thinking about your next startup? Well, it’s not just me, because I have my co-founder and you need to be in sync about what you’re doing. So firstly, I would recommend to any founder, it’s so much better doing it with somebody else than doing it on your own. And it’s easy to be friends with somebody you’ve worked with, but working with a friend is much harder because you may not be friends for long. But I think as we went into this, we’re not thinking about the exit. You go into it assuming it’s going to be a long journey, then it will be a fun journey. To create something takes time. You need to go through the process, and as long as you’re creating value, you actually want to see the realization. I feel when you jump into it just to quickly create and sell, it’s not as much fun and it shows in the company culture. People spend so much time at the company that they need to enjoy being there, so if you’re a company where people love Fridays and hate Mondays, then you’re at the wrong company; it’s time to move on. You don’t seem to have any competition in the EV swapping space. Maybe it’s not such a great idea if no one else is trying to solve the problem in the same way. My co-founder and I connected on this idea of doing things that are very improbable, but possible. You just need to find a potential path. If everybody says, “Oh yeah, this is gonna happen,” it’s too late for us. We know it’s the right time and it’s possible there’s a path, but most people are saying this will never work. That doesn’t discourage us, because it’s clearly in that sector of low probability, and that’s a sector we’re most comfortable in. Better Place tried and failed. Why do you think your company will be successful? We did a lot of research on electric cars before starting this and found electric cars go back a century. One of the reasons people went over from electric to gas was everybody was building specific batteries for each type of car, but gas was possible to use in any car, and that became very convenient. So now with EVs, we’re asking people to go from something very convenient to something that’s exceedingly inconvenient."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/us-puts-drone-maker-dji-and-seven-other-chinese-companies-on-investment-blocklist/","US puts drone maker DJI and seven other Chinese companies on investment blocklist","","The US government will place eight Chinese companies including drone manufacturer DJI on an investment blocklist for alleged involvement in surveillance of Uyghur Muslims, the Financial Times has reported. The firms will reportedly be put on the Treasure department’s “Chinese military-industrial complex companies” list on Tuesday, meaning US citizens will be barred from making any investments. DJI is already on the Department of Commerce’s Entity list, meaning American companies can’t sell it components unless they have a license. At the time, the government said it was among companies that “enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance.” However, unlike products from Huawei and others, DJI drones are have not been banned for sale in the US. Yesterday, the US House and Senate passed a bill that would ban imports from Xinjiang, unless companies could prove they were not made using forced labor. It’s set for a vote in the upper chamber of Congress prior to a holiday recess. Xiaomi was placed on the same investment blocklist early in 2021. However, it fought the decision, saying that none of its principals were connected with the Chinese military and that a lack of US investment would lead to “immediate and irreparable harm.” In May, the government agreed to lift the ban. In 2020, DJI commanded a massive 77 percent of the consumer drone market. Over the last two months, it has released a pair of key products, the large-sensor Mavic 3 drone and full-frame Ronin 4D cinema camera with a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system. A year ago, DJI said it had “done nothing to justify being placed on the Entity list,” and that “customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally.” Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on Engadget."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/amazon-to-lower-its-cut-of-alexa-skill-developer-revenue-starting-in-2022/","Amazon to lower its cut of Alexa skill developer revenue starting in 2022","","Amazon is joining other tech giants by lowering its cut of developer revenue generated by voice apps, known as Alexa skills, which run on Amazon’s smart speakers and other Alexa-powered devices. The company this week announced it would next year reduce its commission from 30% to 20% for Alexa skill developers who earn less than $1 million in revenue through things like Skill purchases (paid installs), in-skill purchases (the Alexa equivalent of in-app purchases) and skill subscriptions. The changes will go into effect starting in the second quarter of 2022, and will be joined by an expansion of developer benefits designed to help third-party developers generate traffic and increase their skills’ visibility. Amazon says developers who generate less than $1 million in the previous calendar year, as well as new Alexa developers, will be eligible for the new program. The update to Amazon’s commission structure for Alexa developer revenue follows similar moves made by other tech giants, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Just over a year ago, Apple responded to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its App Store business by dropping its commission rate to 15% for small business developers with less than $1 million in App Store revenues over the course of a year. Previously, those developers had to pay Apple’s standard 30% commission. Google soon followed suit with a similar program for Google Play, which lowered its cut to 15%, with a slight differentiation as to how it calculated when the lowered commissions would apply. Both companies have since gone on to carve out further exceptions to their standard commission rates for select categories of apps, including news publishers and other subscription apps. In addition, Microsoft this year updated its revenue share terms to more favorable rates, with an 85/15 revenue split for app developers using its payments platform and an 88/12 split for game developers. Amazon’s Alexa platform, however, isn’t quite in the same category as these other, larger app ecosystems. While the company had originally planned for a voice app catalog to rival any other app store, the reality is that few developers have been able to capitalize on Alexa’s sizable footprint in U.S. consumers’ homes to create profitable businesses. In other words, Amazon’s adjustment to its commission rates can’t be viewed in the same light as the changes to other app stores’ policies. While, to some extent, Amazon likely feels pressure to follow market trends, it clearly also hopes that lowered commissions could incentivize Alexa developers to build for its platform. In the same announcement, Amazon also said it will roll out more benefits designed to increase developers’ potential revenue under the new program that begins next year. These additional perks could be worth “up to an additional 10 percent” of a developer’s potential revenue, Amazon noted. The benefits will include incentive programs, personalized feedback to help developers optimize their skills, help identifying monetization opportunities, and more. Amazon has repeatedly tried direct payments for top skill developers over the years. It’s unclear for now if the new incentives will be different, or just more of the same. Amazon said it will share more details about the program closer to its launch next year. The company over the past year has tried to bring back interest in skill development by introducing more opportunities to make Alexa skills profitable. It launched Paid Skills, where consumers pay upfront to access the add-on voice app, introduced Alexa Shopping Actions to allow developers to sell from Amazon.com within their skill (and earn affiliate income), expanded access to in-skill purchases to more international developers and reduced the cost of hosting skills to nearly $0.    "
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/oppo-decreases-the-crease-for-its-new-foldable/","Oppo decreases the crease for its new foldable","","The crease, it seems, is unavoidable. It’s right there, smack in the middle of the those big, expensive folding displays. And it’s invariably (and perhaps understandably) the first comment on nearly every story I post about a foldable phone. The alternative isn’t ideal, either — a gap between two distinct displays à la Microsoft’s Surface Duo. The “N” in Oppo’s new Find N foldable doesn’t stand for “no crease,” exactly, but all reports thus far point to a reduction of that being among the biggest aesthetic complaints revolving around the first few generations of foldables. It is, according to Oppo, “up to 80% less noticeable” than on standard foldables. Crease detection is, of course, in the eye of the beholder, but more than anything, it depends on how the light hits the screen. But either way, the crease has been a kind of nagging nuisance — far more than the notch — in the fact that it cuts right down the center of the screen. What’s notable here is how much work Oppo has been putting in behind the scenes. The company decidedly did not rush this thing to market. It reportedly comes on the tail of six generations of internally developed prototypes as part of a project the hardware maker has been operating since 2018. The whole of the foldable landscape has decidedly been a mixed bag, thus far — with some of those failures self-inflected. The broad consensus is that Samsung was just too quick to market with its first foldable, though subsequent generations have made the product much more viable for consumer usage. There’s nothing mainstream about them yet (sorry Samsung), but they’ve undoubtedly come a long way, and the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the first time I’ve seriously thought “I could use this phone” during the testing process. Huawei’s original Mate X was promising the few times I had occasion to use it, but that, too, was sidelined when the company ultimately went back to the drawing board. And in the meantime, other, bigger issues than that have been plaguing the hardware maker. Meanwhile, Motorola’s first attempt at a foldable Razr was a flop, though it has managed to correct some of those mistakes with a second generation. From the looks of it, Oppo has avoided some of those pitfalls by waiting. Truth of the matter is, in this industry, being the first to something isn’t always an advantage. At a certain point in the process, you’re effectively doing widespread beta testing among early adopters. And while I sadly wasn’t at Oppo’s big show this week (though Rita’s been doing a splendid job covering it for us), hands-ons have been complimentary with regards to the numerous things the company did right here. At the very least, it’s easy to see Oppo got a lot right with the 18:9 aspect ratio in that — unlike other foldables — it looks like a phone when closed. It’s admittedly pretty thick when closed, but the hinge does a good job keeping the displays flush. At 7.1-inches, the screen falls short of the Fold 3’s 7.6-inches, though I suspect the former is large enough for most folks who feel compelled toward these devices. It’s worth noting, too, that Samsung Display made the folding screen (though Oppo says it did a lot of proprietary work on top) — which means that, even if Oppo does well, Samsung still gets a cut. A rising tide lifts all boats, I suppose, assuming all of those boats happen to be largely comprised of Samsung components. The rub here — and it’s a big one — is that this is a China-only device. The world’s largest smartphone market, it seems, is enough for Oppo. Of course, now that OnePlus has effectively ahem folded into Oppo, perhaps there’s some opportunity for synergy there. The brand has notably been toying around with its own foldable concepts of late."

2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/avantstay-a-platform-for-kitting-out-and-then-renting-out-high-end-vacation-rental-homes-raises-160m/","AvantStay, a platform for kitting out — and then renting out — high-end vacation rental homes, raises $160M","","Another travel startup that found itself scrambling to pivot as the COVID-19 pandemic took off is now announcing a huge round of funding after finding its feet and proving that it can grow, even under adverse circumstances. AvantStay — which has built a platform where it decorates and then lists properties owned by others for people to rent out for vacations or other short-term stays — has raised $160 million in a Series B round of funding. The company saw revenues grow tenfold in the last two years and its total number of properties balloon to over 1,000, and now it will use the new funding for expansion, specifically adding more properties to its platform; and to continue developing its technology as it expands into more aspects of the property rentals business. Tarsadia Investments and 3L Capital (which led its Series A) co-led this round, with participation also from previous backers Plus Capital, Bullpen Capital and Convivialite; new, strategic investors Capital One, Saluda Grade, Coller, Greenhawk, Stephen Pagliuca, Fred Tuomi, Jerry Coleman and Jay Mckee; and celebrity investors including Paul George and Shawn Mendes. AvantStay’s basic premise is based around kitting out and then handling the rentals for high-end homes as a viable alternative, or even improvement on, the experience that a typical guest might have had in a five-star hotel; and it has harnessed technology in aid of that. The tools that it has built include Voyage, its proprietary operating system to manage properties; a concierge app to help its guests with services before, during and after stays; its front-end booking platform; and a recently launched real estate platform. The concierge service is part of AvantStay’s strategy of complementing its rentals with as many amenities as guests might have in high-end hotels — and among its tech investment plans, it wants to continue extending the services that can be offered on it. The startup will also continue to evolve the real estate business, where it helps connect vacation property investors with properties, acting as the broker and then the sole agent for renting those homes out. (But to be clear, it does not own properties itself.) Los Angeles-based AvantStay has been around since 2017 and had only raised $25 million in the last four years. In that context, this funding is significant — and large for a Series B — and underscores some of the traction the company has been having, especially at a time when vacationing all but ground to a halt. The company said that in the last two years it added more than 700 homes and 80 new destinations (some in part by way of six acquisitions that it has made in that time), and it grew revenues 10x. In all, Sean Breuner, AvantStay’s CEO who co-founded the company with Reuben Doetsch (the CTO), said that 750,000 guests stay in its network of properties, with the average number per homes being seven guests. It’s currently not profitable, but it actually did tip into profitability during the pandemic, cutting lots of costs and also shifting to longer-term rentals aimed at corporates. It is not the only venture-backed startup that has found an exit route out of what might otherwise have been a dire situation. Experiences platforms Peek and Easol both found traction as providers of tech to the creators and organizers of those events; HotelEngine and OTA Insight, building tools for accommodation providers, also have recently raised big rounds to capitalize on their own recent growth. Airbnb has created and leads the market for private home accommodation — and it happens to be one of 60 partners that AvantStay has secured for marketing the homes on its platform — but Breuner believes the opportunity to develop a business distinct from that, aimed specifically at the opportunity with higher-end properties, still has a lot of growth left in it in its own right, in part because there are still a lot of consumers and business travelers that have yet to accept that they could have an experience better than what they have at high-end hotels. “Customers are starting to meet the demand from an experience perspective in rental homes,” he said. “It has always lagged hotels by a wide margin. But the experience now matches the needs and requirements of what a guest is looking for.” “Since we led AvantStay’s Series A investment over two years ago, we’ve watched the company not only grow their supply and revenue tenfold, but also navigate one of the worst possible macro shocks that occurred in the hospitality industry,” said Jodi Kessler, a partner at 3L, in a statement. “Their incredible execution and resilience, combined with a massive tailwind in the travel sector for AvantStay’s product makes us excited to double down on and support the team as they continue to build both a world-class hospitality brand for travelers, and a vertically integrated platform through which individuals and institutions can invest in short-term rental properties.”"
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/aurora-self-driving-trucks-are-using-uber-freight-to-haul-goods-for-customers/","Aurora self-driving trucks are using Uber Freight to haul goods for customers","","Aurora’s self-driving trucks are hauling goods for Uber Freight customers in Texas as part of a multiphase commercial pilot that aims to more closely integrate the two companies.  While the pilot was officially announced Wednesday, Aurora’s self-driving trucks, which always have two vehicle safety operators on board, have been working with Uber Freight for about a year, according to a spokesperson. The news marks a progression from those early tests to a formal commercial pilot. Aurora is using the Uber Freight brokerage platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered, to haul freight for customers between Dallas and Houston. Aurora said it will expand routes as it adds more terminals.  Hauling goods via the Uber Freight platform is notable. The real opportunity, which the companies also plan to do, is to integrate Aurora’s trucking subscription service into Uber Freight. The trucking subscription service called Aurora Horizon can be thought of as an overarching digital and logistics companion to the self-driving system. Under Aurora Horizon are several other products, including a mission control system that integrates with a carrier or network’s system and app to communicate dispatching and routing, monitor vehicle health and handle incident response and a roadside assistance program. Aurora plans to launch its autonomous trucking business by the end of 2023. If the pilot with Uber Freight succeeds, carriers with subscriptions to Aurora Horizon will be able to access Uber Freight to haul more goods. Aurora’s pitch is that this will improve efficiency for carriers and ensure trucking capacity isn’t underutilized. The announcement Wednesday is also a reminder of Aurora and Uber’s close ties. Aurora acquired Uber ATG, the company’s self-driving unit, a year ago. As part of that complex deal, Aurora didn’t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company. Aurora was privately held at the time, a status that changed in 2021 when it merged with a special purpose acquisition company. Aurora became a publicly traded company in November.  Meanwhile, Uber Freight has been making its own moves. The logistics business, which spun out of Uber in 2018, acquired Transplace for about $2.25 billion from private equity group TPG Capital earlier this year. The acquisition is part of Uber Freight’s aim to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expand into Mexico."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/quo-com-raises-7-2m-seed-round-led-by-signalfire-to-broaden-access-to-mortgages/","Quo.com raises $7.2M seed round led by SignalFire to broaden access to mortgages","","Almost three million Americans a year are denied a mortgage. Most don’t even know where to start or understand what would qualify them. The system has become complex and confusing, causing people to never make it onto the housing ladder at all. This is in contrast to the mortgage industry, which is leaving these people on the table by being geared only to those who are ready and qualified to buy, a relatively small percentage of those who’d actually like to. Fintech startups like NerdWallet, Lower.com, Divvy and Landis have appeared in recent years trying to, for instance, make it easier to save for home loans. But there’s clearly plenty of room for more entrants, especially ones that can hand-hold consumers through the complex process. Quo is a relatively new startup with what it claims is a fresh approach to homeownership. Its consumer-oriented app shows users where they are today in terms of their financial position and goes through what mortgage qualification criteria they need to hit in order to secure a home loan. It has now raised $7.2 million in a seed funding round led by SignalFire, with participation by Justin Mateen and current investors Soma Capital, Global Founders Capital and others. Alongside that, it has also acquired Uncapped Mortgage, a licensed mortgage brokerage startup based out of Nashville, and re-branded it to QuoHome. QuoHome provides mortgage brokering services for Quo users once they are ready to buy. The bulk of the new funding will be used to accelerate the growth of the QuoHome coaching app. Quo claims its users have amassed $200 million in home buying power and are working towards $1.2 billion in homes, growing at over 100% CMGR. The Quo product works by connecting to your credit, savings and income information to build a financial profile. It then compares your information to mortgage underwriting guidelines to assess how much you can afford today and the bar you need to hit across credit, debt and savings to afford the home you want. It then finds shortcuts for you to be able to afford a home faster, such as working out whicht debts you should pay off, versus saving that money for a down payment. Quo was founded in 2018 by Tucker Haas and Neel Yerneni while they were seniors at Stanford University with the mission to make building wealth more equitable, starting with homeownership. Haas says he grew up in a household that struggled with home financing for years after they got into economic problems. “Having grown up in a low-income household, I had firsthand experience with a broken financial system. Quo is our way of driving at the mission of making building wealth more equitable,” he said. “Since launching the beta in June, our members now manage over $21 million in home savings with Quo and are building towards almost half a billion dollars in homes. With our $7.2 million in funding led by SignalFire, we’re proving there’s a more aligned and accessible way to approach this industry.” Josh Constine of Signalfire commented: “I think the big trend here is economic uncertainty spurring a new wave of fintech for savings and homeownership as the middle-class tries to find some stability.”"
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/google-france-antitrust-news-litigation-settlement-offer/","Google offers behavioral pledges on news payments in France to try to end costly antitrust litigation","What is Google offering in France?","In its latest move to placate European competition regulators, Google has offered a set of commitments to France’s antitrust watchdog — in the hopes of settling a costly (for it) intervention over legally mandated payments for displaying snippets of news publishers’ content. Back in July, France’s Autorité de la Concurrence slapped the tech giant with a fine of half a billion euros over a series of suspected breaches in how it negotiated with news publishers to remunerate them for reuse of their content. The backstory here is the European Union agreed to a reform of digital copyright rules, back in 2019, which (among other changes) extended copyright law to cover snippets of news publishers’ content that were being routinely reused by aggregators like Google News. While there was plenty of criticism of the reform at the time, the directive has given the bloc’s news publishers leverage over Google and does appear to have contributed to the adtech giant’s decision to abandon its earlier hard line stance — of saying it would never pay a penny for news content — in favor of creating its own content licensing product aimed at news publishers. However that News Showcase product looked like a cynical attempt by Google to more cheaply circumvent legal requirements by using a global news licensing vehicle to bundle compliance with a growing number of national laws on news content remuneration (see also: Australia, which earlier this year passed a law requiring Google and Facebook engage in mandatory negotiations with publishers over content reuse) — and grab itself sweeping rights to publishers’ content in the process — and that’s exactly the sort of “bad faith” behavior that Google is being called out for in France. Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets  France was one of the first EU Member States to transpose the pan-EU copyright directive into national law, and the Autorité has taken an aggressive approach to enforcing complaints over Google’s compliance with the new rules. So, for example, when Google sought to evade application of the law in the country — by stopping displaying snippets of local publishers’ content unless publishers gave it free authorization to show them — the watchdog slapped down the practice, finding last year that it was likely to be abuse of a dominant market position; and telling Google it could not just unilaterally withdraw the content. It also ordered Google to negotiate in good faith with publishers to pay for displaying their legally protected content — giving it three months to do so. After which, following a number of complaints by French publishers, the Autorité stepped in again to investigate Google’s behavior. And it went on to apply interim measures in July, based on its preliminary concerns. In a nutshell, the Autorité believes Google has applied “unfair and discriminatory settlement conditions”; and is likely to have sought to circumvent the law on “related rights” — although its investigation continues in parallel with the intervention. The latest development now is that the Autorité has published details of a set of commitments Google has offered to try to resolve the investigation. The watchdog is consulting on the proposals — inviting interested third parties, publishers and news agencies to submit comments before January 31, 2022. It will then hold a hearing with relevant parties and could choose to close the case — if it decides Google’s commitments are acceptable — at which point it would make them binding on Google. It could also opt to amend and beef up the commitments. So Google’s offer is by no means the final word. Over in the U.K., meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority is undertaking a similar procedure in relation to Google’s planned deprecation of tracking cookies to migrate to alternative ad targeting tech — with the CMA currently consulting on commitments Google has offered around its Privacy Sandbox proposal (and in that case if they are accepted Google has said it will apply them globally) — underlining the growing influence European regulators are having over the future shape of Big Tech. Germany’s Federal Cartel Office also has an in-train procedure related to Google’s News Showcase T&Cs. So Google is likely facing more antitrust action on this front in Europe. Google agrees with UK’s CMA to deeper oversight of Privacy Sandbox  The Autorité said Google has proposed the following “remedies”: In its own blog post about the proposals (written in French), attributed to Sébastien Missoffe, VP and CEO of Google France, Google points to recent deals it has inked with local publishers (such as AFP) — claiming this sums to “significant progress” on reaching an entente cordiale on the news numeration issue, while acknowledging negotiations with other French publishers are still ongoing. Google condenses what it’s proposing — and what it hopes will end the expensive litigation, with Missoffe suggesting the proposals will “open a new chapter in the area of <U+200B><U+200B>Neighboring Rights” — under the following three subtitles: “Specific offers on neighboring rights”; “Respect for the choices of the publishers”; and “More transparency and independent supervision”. And we could perhaps further condense that to an offer of “specific respect, supervised”. It’s certainly notable that both the Autorité’s intervention over news and the CMA’s investigation of Google’s Privacy Sandbox have led to an offer — by Google — of an monitoring trustee to verify compliance, underlying how little trust advertisers and publishers have in the tech giant doing the right thing when no one is looking. Indeed, the first set of commitments Google offered the CMA did not go far enough to convince the wider market which feeds Google’s ad coffers that it would play fair — leading Google to come back with enhanced commitments (including the offer of the monitoring trustee and a slight extension to the length of time the commitments would be enforced). It remains to be seen whether publishers in France will be content with Google’s first offer — or also push for greater assurances that the tech giant will play fair over news remuneration. Google, meanwhile, signs off its blog post by claiming its “objective” is to “conclude definitive agreements, in compliance with the law, and to open a new chapter with press editors”. But the prospect of a $592 million fine has doubtless helped concentrate minds in Mountain View vis-à-vis compliance with French law. “Regardless of these commitments, Google will continue to invest, as we have for years, in products and training to support journalism,” Missoffe adds in remarks that are of course irrelevant to the specific issue of compliance with French law. France’s competition watchdog orders Google to pay for news reuse  Google to pay out $1B to publishers to license content for new Google News Showcase   "
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/for-course-hero-venture-capital-was-once-an-unobvious-solution/","For Course Hero, venture capital was once an unobvious solution","The edtech company just landed a $380M Series C at $3.6B valuation"," Launched in 2006, education startup Course Hero started its life away from the attention of venture capital. After launching, the company waited eight years to raise a $15 million Series A. Then, after going another nearly six years without raising venture capital, Course Hero closed two financings in 2020. Yesterday, the edtech company announced yet another tranche of capital: a $380 million Series C at a $3.6 billion valuation. The financing, led by Wellington Management with participation from new investors Sequoia Capital Global Equities, OMERS Growth Equity and D1 Capital Partners, as well as existing investors, brings a 227.3% increase to Course Hero’s valuation in a little over a year. The business has been cash flow positive and profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis for over five years, it claims. The raise comes as a stark contrast to CEO and co-founder Andrew Grauer’s comments in 2020, when he spoke on the “risk and reward of raising capital.” “If you raise too much money early on, you can get misaligned expectations based on different time horizons set up by different terms of incoming shareholders or investors,” he said. Course Hero’s rapid capitalization today thus suggests that Grauer now thinks that the startup has graduated past a point of dealing with unfavorable incentives from its investors. And to be fair, his new vision for the company makes a good argument for why he needs so much capital in this given moment.  Image Credits: Course Hero The founder believes that Course Hero has evolved past its main business model — a place where students can come to access more than 80 million course-specific study resources and guides — into a platform play. Going forward, Course Hero will formalize its mass consolidation mindset, as we’ve seen through its acquisitions of Symbolab, LitCharts, CliffsNotes and QuillBot, as a business strategy. “We’re working to build a platform that serves the entire learning journey, almost like a productivity suite for learning,” he said. “Each business will continue to build their products and brands, and there’s an opportunity for us to build an ecosystem to integrate the products into each other that create more value for learners and educators.” PR-speak aside, the capital will be used to fuel acquisitions. And we know edtech is full of them. Grauer estimates that he can grow Course Hero from gaining 2 million subscribers per year to 50 million subscribers per year by 2030 by serving more than just as a “study platform for students and a resource for educators.” Going forward, students will be able to go to coursehero.com like they traditionally have, but also navigate to its broader product and brand suite. “The last two years we have seen a bigger shift in advancing pedagogy online and the way that we evaluate and assess student comprehension is evolving as a result,” he told TechCrunch. “All of these changes require better, more affordable and effective resources, tools and services to meet the needs of today’s students and educators.” The co-founder explained that he plans to use the new capital to acquire businesses operating in new verticals, subject areas, grade levels and countries. “This definitely includes a focus on technical topics and skills as well as tool-driven product solutions,” he added. And clearly, there’s still solid room to grow. Grauer said that Course Hero hasn’t yet begun to “fully dive into crypto and web3,” a movement that could definitely use some translation help to the legions of people who haven’t fallen down the rabbit hole just yet. As the company’s total addressable market becomes broader, and hopefully more diverse, Course Hero will need to evolve to support a whole range of learning needs — not just requests for 24/7 homework help or study guides on the latest lit assignment."

To this end, players such as Wyre (raised $29.1 million) and MoonPay (raised $555 million) have risen to the fore. But in the summer of this year, a similar, U.K.-based startup called Ramp (not to be confused with U.S. “trad-fi” startup Ramp) de-cloaked like a Klingon battleship in space, with a $10.1 million seed round, and even had hard-won approval from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under its belt. The company is now clearly on a roll. Ramp has now raised a $52.7 million Series A round led by Balderton Capital. Existing investors NFX, Galaxy Digital, Seedcamp and Firstminute Capital also participated, alongside angel investors including Taavet Hinrikus (Wise) and Francesco Simoneschi (TrueLayer), and the investment will see Balderton’s General Partner Rana Yared join the Ramp board. The startup has now raised a total of $63 million. Founded in 2017 by Szymon Sypniewicz (CEO) and Przemek Kowalczyk (CTO, CPO), Ramp has a non-custodial, full-stack payment infrastructure. The idea here is to open up digital assets to more businesses and users by making it possible to send or receive crypto without having to go through an exchange like Coinbase, for instance. Ramp allows anyone that wants to offer crypto-enabled services to do so via its SDK in a few hours, without the need to set up their own on-ramping stack to an exchange, an extremely time-consuming and potentially costly business. This is, of course, very advantageous to Ramp, because it forces users to move between Ramp-powered services without having to jump through multiple verification hoops. Faster for the users, but also great for Ramp. In part because of this ease of use, it’s managed to partner up with more than 400 developers, including Mozilla, Browser and Dapper Labs and DeFi apps like Aave, Argent, Trust Wallet and Zerion. It is also the exclusive on-ramping partner for Sorare, the blockchain-based, global sports video game, and Flow, the blockchain which specializes in NFT marketplaces and digital assets. Furthermore, users of the Opera browser can top-up crypto wallets from within the app, or Sorare NFT game players can buy and sell virtual players via Ethereum. In addition, the NFT-based game Axie Infinity used Ramp to shorten its onboarding process from two hours to minutes. The ultimate vision is to facilitate crypto transactions for banks’ or other financial institutions’ end-users within their banking apps. This would be where TradFi meets DeFi. Ramp has also recently received regulatory approval from U.S. FinCen — the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which enables the company to operate legally in the U.S. And in Poland, it has become the first on-ramping company to receive an open banking license from The Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) in 2020. Szymon Sypniewicz, Ramp co-founder and CEO, said: “There is so much potential in unlocking cryptocurrency and digital assets beyond today’s narrow and restrictive use cases. We’re on a mission to provide instant access to cryptocurrencies through a provider they can trust.” On its competitive position against Wyre and MoonPay, a spokesperson said Ramp is focusing on transaction transparency and regulatory approval, hence the FCA and FinCen stuff: “While several competitors prefer to embed some of their fees in conversion rates, Ramp prides itself on showing its fees up-front so that consumers know exactly what they are paying for.”"

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. The note changed the bank’s valuation perspective regarding a number of technology companies. In response to what CNBC described as a “wave of downgrades” from JP Morgan, investors pulled the rug on a few notable tech companies. Here’s a partial list of the damage from yesterday’s trading, after the downgrades were made public: You get the picture. But what’s more important is that the note connected rising interest rates to an anticipated decline in the value of various technology shares. To wit: “With rates climbing, this adds risk to higher multiple software stocks trading over 20 times revenue,” per a CNBC quote of the note. (A longer list of upgrades and downgrades from the communiqué can be found here.) If tech companies valued at more than 20x revenues see their valuations decline as rates rise, it would create a downward compression effect on tech valuations more generally. Put simply: If the tech companies with the richest valuations were dragged closer to a 20x multiple, it would slash the worth of nearly every tech company, period. "
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/disney-rolls-out-support-for-apples-shareplay-co-viewing-experience-over-facetime/","Disney+ rolls out support for Apple’s SharePlay co-viewing experience over FaceTime","","Disney+ is the latest streaming app to add support for Apple’s SharePlay, the iOS 15 feature that offers a co-viewing experience over FaceTime video calls on iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV devices. First announced during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, SharePlay rolled out with the iOS 15.1 update, soon offering co-viewing experiences across a variety of apps, including NBA, TikTok, Twitch, Paramount+ and Showtime, as well as Apple’s own apps like Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Fitness, among others. Disney+, however, has been a long-awaited addition to this lineup, as Apple had announced during WWDC that the streaming service would be among those supporting the new feature. Today, the companies are making good on that promise with the release of a Disney+ app update that will allow subscribers to use the SharePlay feature on Apple’s iOS, iPadOS and tvOS devices. Disney says the feature will be compatible globally across the entire Disney+ catalog from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. This includes its new titles like Marvel Studios’ “Hawkeye,” “Welcome to Earth” and its upcoming Disney+ premieres, like “Encanto,” which arrives on Christmas Eve (December 24), and the “The Book of Boba Fett,” which becomes available starting on December 29.  Image Credits: Disney Once updated, users will be able to host and attend SharePlay sessions that allow up to 32 people to co-watch Disney+ together. This could make for an easy way for a family who can’t be together for the holidays to have a Disney movie night, for example, or a way to entertain the kids by having them stream Disney+ with friends back home while out of town for a holiday trip, among other things. The SharePlay feature itself is relatively easy to use as it’s built into the FaceTime app. To use the feature, you’ll first start the FaceTime call, then open the Disney+ app. A notice will appear at the top of the screen alerting you that SharePlay is available. You’ll tap play on the content you want to watch and begin watching with everyone else on the call. The playback controls are available to everyone else on the SharePlay session, allowing each user to press play, pause, rewind or fast forward. Disney notes that each participant can select the audio and subtitles in the language of their choice when streaming on their device. The feature also offers multiple viewing options, allowing people to watch the streaming content on their Apple TV while still FaceTiming with friends and family on their iPhone. SharePlay has been one of the more interesting features in the iOS 15 release, as it seems like a natural next direction for the FaceTime software in an age where social distancing and remote work have become the norm, and apps like Zoom have crossed into consumer territory. In addition to supporting co-watching, users can also screen-share over SharePlay, even launching apps and browsing together — great for anything from online shopping to offering aging family members remote tech support. To use SharePlay to stream Disney+, all participants must be running at least iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1 and tvOS 15.1, and they’ll need to be a Disney+ subscriber. Though Disney is embracing SharePlay, its own in-app co-viewing feature, called GroupWatch, will continue to be available to all subscribers in the same country across compatible devices. “We’re very excited to launch SharePlay on Disney+ for Apple users in time for the holidays and ahead of several highly anticipated premieres,” said Jerrell Jimerson, EVP of Product & Design, Disney Streaming, in a statement. “With thousands of movies and shows and a growing content catalog of new titles and originals, SharePlay provides another opportunity for personal friends and family around the world to come together and create new memories with their favorite stories on Disney+,” he added."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/e-commerce-marketplace-the-list-checks-off-new-funding-new-app/","E-commerce marketplace The List checks off new funding, new app","","The List joins the social commerce movement with a new app connecting consumers with global luxury brands and retailers to offer a personalized discovery and shopping experience. Focused on sourcing hard-to-find items, the app launch is buoyed by $3.5 million in seed funding backed by a group including American Designer and Rachel Zoe, who is both an investor and advisor to the New York-based company. The List, with offices in Dubai and Lisbon, was founded in 2016 as an e-commerce marketplace and works with authorized, professional sellers. Its new app is an extension of the marketplace, merging content, social networking and live commerce. “The foundation of our business is to help retail stores and brands join the e-commerce wave that is happening,” The List founder and CEO Andreas Skorski told TechCrunch. “We built machine learning and computer vision into the supply chain so they can plug and play into a store. We also have multiple APIs to sync and digitalize inventory to create a product catalogue.” App features include the ability to livestream with a retailer, brand or personal shopper, ask questions in real time and receive recommendations or in-store presentations. Shoppers can follow their favorite brands and stores and engage when images or videos are shoppable. They can also upload a photo of an item to the seller network and get its sourced fast and at the best possible price. On the seller side of the app, you can set up a digital store in minutes and determine how their brand and products will be presented and promoted. The List takes care of the entire fulfilment process, including insurance, taxes and duties, as well as store-to-door express delivery to 190 countries. For years, China led in social commerce, but it became a more popular concept in the United States during the global pandemic.  As such, Grand View Research reported earlier this year that the global social commerce market was forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion by 2028 from growing annually by over 28% between now and then. Social commerce is also proving to be global, with companies across the world finding success is this sector and attracting venture capital to back it up. For example, in November, Facily, a Brazil-based social commerce marketplace, closed on a $250 million Series D round. Prior to that, Evermos an Indonesian social commerce startup, raised $30 million in Series B funding. Meanwhile, The List works with over 150 retail partners around the world, and while the U.S. is The List’s largest market, the app launch will help it grow into additional markets and offer products in different languages. The new funding will enable the company to grow aggressively and add to its 55-person workforce. Over the past year, The List saw growth on both sides of its business model, with several hundred people joining the supply side, and on the consumer side, revenue jumped by a couple thousand percent, Skorski said. In fact, this year’s Black Friday in November contributed to the best month ever in company history, he added. “Digital sales has taken a dominant role, much like how restaurants have iPads at tables,” Skorski said. “The same will happen in the retail space, and it will be a matter of who gets there faster. We are creating this world to enable true storytelling in its best form.” Livestream e-commerce: Why companies and brands need to tune in "

While it still does that, it has shifted focus to API security, and today it announced a $60 million Series C. Menlo Ventures led the latest round with participation from new investors Icon Ventures, Telstra Ventures and HarbourVest Partners along with existing investors Shasta Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital and T-Mobile Ventures. The company said it has now raised $100 million. CEO Larry Link said that the startup was seeing more vulnerabilities through APIs with customers, and they began to shift the focus of the Cequence analytics engine to find those kinds of vulnerabilities. “We now will discover what your API footprint looks like. [Without having] to instrument it, we’re finding things, and then we detect [any] abuse that’s going on on those API endpoints, and then we can mitigate that. So that’s how the product has evolved,” Link told me. He said that Cequence looks at approximately 150 data points to determine if the activity is something to worry about. “So we look at individual requests first, and then we look at clustering of requests second, and then we look at the intent of those requests third, and that’s where we tease things out like, ‘Hey, this is an account takeover attack, or this is a credential stuffing attack, or this is an inventory manipulation attack,'” he said. Link said the company grew 2.5x over the last year and that there is a lot of room for growth. “We’re not releasing our revenue numbers, but it’s a very healthy growth rate and pretty high ARR for this kind of the business, and that’s why we wanted to raise this Series C, because we have a lot of opportunity. We need to fuel that,” he said. The startup has just over 100 employees today and could reach as high as 250 by the end of 2022, depending on how the business goes. Link said that as the company expanded over the last year and moved at least partly remote, the workforce has grown more diverse. “We’re big believers in the value of a diverse workforce. We think it gives us better insight and is a better platform to grow and expand the company. So the recent change in the last year and a half where some jobs need to be HQ-based, but most of our jobs can be working from anywhere. And this is kind of a new transition that we’ve seen, and it’s enabling us to get, I think, a better quality workforce and also a more diverse workforce,” he said. This is Link’s fifth startup. His previous job before joining Cequence was VP of Sales at Palo Alto Networks. The founders hired him after starting the company to add an experienced industry veteran to run the show."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/apple-removes-csam-detection-website/","Apple quietly pulls references to its CSAM detection tech after privacy fears","","Apple has quietly removed from its website all references to its child sexual abuse scanning feature, months after announcing that the new technology would be baked into iOS 15 and macOS Monterey. Back in August, Apple announced that it would introduce the feature to allow the company to detect and report known child sexual abuse material, known as CSAM, to law enforcement. At the time, Apple claimed — unlike cloud providers that already offered blanket scanning to check for potentially illegal content — it could detect known illegal imagery while preserving user privacy, because the technology could identify known CSAM on a user’s device without having to possess the image or device, or knowing its contents. Apple faced a monumental backlash in response. Security experts and privacy advocates expressed concern that the system could be abused by highly resourced actors, like governments, to implicate innocent victims or to manipulate the system, while others ridiculed it as being ineffective at identifying images of child sexual abuse.This led to dozens of civil liberties groups calling on Apple to abandon plans to roll out the controversial feature. Despite a publicity blitz that followed in an effort to assuage fears, Apple relented, announcing a delay to the rollout of the CSAM scanning feature. The company said “based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.” Now it looks like the feature might have been scrapped altogether. MacRumours first noticed that all mentions of CSAM have been quietly scrubbed from Apple’s Child Safety webpage. Up until December 10, this page included a detailed overview of CSAM detection and a promise that the controversial feature would be “coming later this year in updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey.” The updated version of the page removes not only the section on CSAM detection but also scrubs all references to the technology and a section offering links to documents explaining and assessing the CSAM process. Now, Apple’s Child Safety page only contains a reference to Communication safety in Messages and expanded guidance for Siri, Spotlight and Safari Search, the former having debuted on iOS 15 earlier this week. Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer told TechCrunch that “nothing has changed” with respect to its September statement announcing the delay to its feature, but would not say for what reason the references to its CSAM feature were removed.

Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. In selling 35 million shares, the company had gross initial proceeds of $805 million from its IPO.

Ahead of Samsara’s public trading this morning, we’re taking a brief look at its final IPO valuation and final revenue multiples, then chatting about the recent downturn in SaaS prices and what could be on the horizon. There are two valuations that we care about regarding Samsara’s IPO. We want its simple, or non-diluted, valuation. And we want its fully diluted valuation. The latter number will include more total shares, adding equity that has been vested through options and the like, but not yet exercised. Per our prior calculations, here’s where the numbers sit for the now-public entity: Our math also indicated that Samsara is worth around 27x its most recent run rate at the latter valuation.

Peloton spilled users’ private account information; Experian exposed the financial histories of millions of Americans; and Facebook, LinkedIn and Clubhouse all had user data scraped en masse because of their poorly secured APIs. For companies like Noname Security that aim to solve API security problems, business is booming. The Palo Alto-headquartered company today announced it’s raised $135 million in Series C funding, pushing the startup over the $1 billion valuation mark, making it the latest startup to join the cybersecurity unicorn club. The round was led by Georgian and Lightspeed, with participation from Insight Partners, Forgepoint and others. The funding comes just six months after Noname closed a $60 million round of funding at Series B, less than a year after raising $25 million at Series A after emerging from stealth last December. For those keeping count, that’s $220 million raised by the company to date. Noname helps companies proactively discover and remediate API security issues by analyzing configuration settings, network traffic and code to prevent misuse. APIs, in simple terms, allow two or more things to talk to each other over the internet, including hardware and software. APIs are pretty much everywhere, even if you can’t see them. But without controls in place, APIs can be abused to siphon off tons of sensitive or private internal data from a company’s servers.

Well, three years later that company just landed a $65 million Series C, and it’s rolling along. Steadfast Capital led the latest round, with participation from existing investor NEA and new investors Sound Ventures and K9 Ventures along with individual investors including actress Gwyneth Paltrow and former NBA player Baron Davis. The company has now raised $92 million. Company CEO and co-founder Deon Nicholas says that like many companies, his benefited as the pandemic forced companies to digitally transform faster than they might have, and this was particularly true in the customer service market where Forethought’s products are aimed. “This explosion in digital transformation, as well as I would say just the loss of human productivity [during the early part of the pandemic] led to a lot of businesses to turn to artificial intelligence, and obviously to Forethought, to help with this digital transformation,” Nicholas told me. He says that the new money should help take advantage of the rapid growth the company has been experiencing. In the last year, they have seen ARR grow 5x, while tripling the number of customers. The company now has three main customer service products. First it has the Assist, which helps CSAs find the information they need to solve a problem quickly, Solve is a chatbot to help answer simple questions and route the more complex ones to human CSAs and Triage uses AI to route the call to the most knowledgeable CSA to get the call answered most efficiently. He says the goal is to help humans perform better using AI. “One of the things that we’ve focused on is being a human-centered AI platform. And that’s what has really come through…with our mission, and really our mission is to unlock human potential through artificial intelligence,” he said. As a Black co-founder Nicholas is keenly aware of the numbers out there when it comes to funding for Black founders. In fact, in the first half of 2021, just 1.2% of venture money went to startups with a Black founder, according to data from Crunchbase. And that was a big improvement over last year. “In many ways, investors are making these gut decisions that they think are based on the company or the metrics or whatever, but oftentimes it’s based on their [idea] of what they think a founder should look like. And often if you don’t fit that mold, whether that’s because of your appearance, your skin color or your particular background, it can be tough because you’re battling these implicit judgment biases,” he said. One of the outcomes he hopes for from his startup’s journey, is that his story inspires young people of color looking to start a company. “One of my hopes is that my personal story becomes one that can help the next generation of entrepreneurs see that there are examples of that,” he said. Today, the company is up to 145 employees and with the new cash, Nicholas expects to reach around 250 by the end of next year. He recognizes the need for diversity, especially in a business that caters to customer service agents. “We care about building an organization that is not only representative, but as you know, more diverse organizations lead to better decision making and just better products. Not to mention that when we think about the industry we serve, customer service…it’s global. It’s broad,” he said. “So for the people we serve, it’s very important that the people building the technology, as well AI and things like that, it’s very important that we understand and are representative of the people we serve,” he said. The company could move beyond customer service over time, with Nicholas saying the company is looking at adjacent areas like sales. With $65 million, the company can afford to put some R&D resources into other areas, while still contributing to AI research and refining and building on the current customer service focus.

To combat this, railway companies demand more robust cyber solutions and lawmakers across the globe call for more effective cybersecurity regulations. Cylus, a Tel Aviv-based rail cybersecurity startup, built a cybersecurity solution, CylusOne, to protect the global mainline and urban railway companies from an array of threats and risks. Cylus’ solution offers continuous monitoring and 360-degree real-time protection for all rail systems, regardless of size and geography, enabling real-time threat detection, advanced forensics and mitigation, simplified security operations and more. CylusOne takes just a few hours to install, requiring zero downtime, fully integrating with new and legacy systems with no changes to the network architecture required, providing full visibility within seconds.  The Israel-based company announced today it has closed $30 million in a Series B round to help protect trains and metros. The latest capital brings its total funding to over $57 million. The company did not disclose its post-money valuation.  Ibex Investors led the Series B with Vertex Growth Fund, Strides International Business, Magma Venture Partners, Vertex Ventures Israel and GlenRock Israel. Israeli serial entrepreneur Zohar Zisapel, a member of Cylus’ board, also joined the round.  With rising government investment in critical infrastructure and growing cybersecurity regulations in the U.S., Cylus will use the current funding to fuel its growth globally in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific. The company also plans to continuously update its rail cybersecurity platform by adding more specialists in cybersecurity, traffic management and onboard/trackside systems and strengthening its AI and machine learning capabilities, chief executive officer and co-founder of Cylus Amir Levintal told TechCrunch.  “The railways are such an essential part of our critical infrastructure, and really, of our everyday lives, that it is crucial that this industry gets the level of cyber protection it demands and needs,” Levintal said.  Karamba Security raises another $10M for its IoT and automotive security platform  Cylus enables maximum interoperability (train-track coupling) while protecting stationary and moving systems in trains, Levintal continued. He also said that its integrated platform approach allows clients to engage with a single rail cybersecurity solution provider instead of multiple vendors. Other competitors offer only a partial solution for rail cybersecurity, such as those designed solely for onboard systems without signaling protection (or vice versa), Levintal added.  Earlier this week, the company also announced its strategic partnership with France-based Alstom to roll out an advanced rail cybersecurity solution that can protect the Tel-Aviv red line’s signaling and train control systems.   The Global railway cybersecurity solutions market is projected to reach approximately $10.2 billion by 2027. “We have seen a massive wave of digitization in the railway industry over the last few years. Despite this being a very positive trend, it has also entailed an exponential expansion of the surface area hackers can access to penetrate railway networks — which could lead to serious outcomes in one of the most core modes of transportation and critical infrastructure,” said Gal Gitter, partner and managing director of Ibex Investors, who will now become a Cylus board member. “Cylus changes all of that by providing the most advanced and holistic cybersecurity platform for railway networks and operators. Cylus’ platform is already in place across many of the world’s leading railway operators, and we believe it will become the ubiquitous platform used across the industry.” “Cylus provides an essential element of protection to critical infrastructure that will enhance the safety and performance of train systems,” said Tam Hock Chuan, managing director of Vertex Growth Fund. “Vertex Growth is proud to help back Cylus’ technology, which we believe offers the most comprehensive solution for rail cybersecurity on the market today.”  2020 was a record year for Israel’s security startup ecosystem  LG is acquiring automotive cybersecurity startup Cybellum in a $240M deal "

We profiled Rebag back in 2015, when its name included two “g’s,” (gotta love URL availability) and had raised $4 million in seed funding to go after incumbents like The RealReal. Novator led the latest round, with participation from existing investors, including General Catalyst, to bring the company’s total funding to date to $101 million. Charles Gorra, founder and CEO of Rebag, declined to talk about valuation, but did say it was “a steep evolution from the last time.” The “last time” was a $15 million Series D round in 2020, also led by Novator. Online Designer Bag Reseller Rebagg Gains $4 Million In Seed Funding To Take On TheRealReal  At that time, Rebag’s path was uncertain, with the global pandemic, Gorra explained. He took the $15 million to have some buffer as the company weighed its options. What happened was that the company ended up with two strong years of revenue growth — 50% in 2020 and 70% estimation for 2021 — basically close to triple the amount of growth over the two-year period, he said. The company has since seen a trend of owning fewer items, but of those that are purchased, they are of higher quality, are made better, are longer lasting and retain some resale value. That’s important in the luxury space because Rebag’s average ticket is $2,000, so when you spend that kind of money, you want to build trust, Gorra said. In the past 12 months, new categories, like fine jewelry and watches, grew four times. Gorra cites the company’s ability to triple its sourcing capabilities after launching its Clair AI and Clair Trade technology in 2020. The marketplace now has more than 30,000 items. Rebag’s Clair technology suite includes proprietary software that can instantly recognize and price bags from the top 50 luxury brands, through an app or by uploading an image, and an offer from Rebag to buy it. The other software tool is an instant trade-in program for the buying and selling of items in one transaction. Gorra intends to use the new capital to continue technology development on those tools, to add to Rebag’s workforce of 150 people and expand its marketing. The company currently has seven brick-and-mortar stores across New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Beverly Hills and Greenwich, Connecticut, with plans to add more in 2022. “The market for venture capital is active and favorable, and we seized on that opportunity to accelerate funding,” he added. “There is a massive opportunity for the resale market — it is booming, and we believe we have created something special.” Also over the past year, the company modified its retail model, adding high-tech touch points throughout the store, including the “Clair Corner,” a self-service kiosk where customers can receive an instant price quote on the item they are selling. In addition, its “Rebag Bar” in New York offers a personalized digital shopping experience, including being able to purchase and pay for resale items within an hour. Vinted raises $303M for its 2nd-hand clothes marketplace, used by 45M and now valued at $4.5B  Though Gorra believes the luxury goods resale market is still in its infancy, citing that one out of 10 luxury items are transacted in the resale market, there are dozens of secondhand marketplaces for handbags and other items, also those not necessarily luxury goods. The secondhand market is expected to double and reach $77 billion by 2025, according to ThredUp, which went public earlier this year after raising over $300 million in venture-backed funding. Gorra sees The RealReal and Poshmark being the closest competitors to Rebag. Even so, he says that the average ticket purchases are vastly different: The RealReal is $500 and Poshmark is $30 compared to Rebag’s $2,000, he noted. Another differentiator is that Rebag controls the purchases and sales versus some of the other platforms that are peer-to-peer sales, sometimes causing those transactions to take days as each party manages their own sides. “We believe our value prop is on the high-end goods market and want to be the trusted place for premium resale,” Gorra said. “We want to be a leader in this space, where we believe there will eventually be a large resale ecosystem, and we want to be a part of it.” Update 12/15, 8:42 a.m.: The company amended its funding round size to $33 million from $35 million.

It is Latin America’s largest country and has one of the highest interest rate spreads in the world.  To give you an idea of just how bad it is, reports indicated that in 2019, credit card interest rates neared a staggering 300% in Brazil. This is one of the reasons you’re seeing so many fintechs emerge in Latin America.

In another example of how startups in the region are working to boost inclusion as much as innovation, Open Co, a São Paulo-based consumer credit company, announced today that it has raised $115 million in a round led by SoftBank Latin America Fund. Existing backers Raiz Investimentos, IFC and LTS also put money in the round.  Open Co was created earlier this year by the merger of Geru, an eight-year-old online lender, and Rebel, a four-year-old startup using AI and bank account data to underwrite risk and assess clients’ financial health. Its aim is to “finance consumption for Brazilians in a healthy way.” It plans to do this in a few ways, but for starters, by not charging 300% interest rates. “Access to good quality credit at the point and time of need is the single most important obstacle for Brazilians to achieve financial wellness, increase consumption and create wealth,” said Sandro Reiss, Open Co’s co-founder. “It’s a huge market that is still controlled by incumbents charging extremely high interest rates, which makes it difficult for people to pay back their loans. It is a vicious cycle; delinquencies are high and interest rates even higher. Our mission is to change that.”  Open Co provides clients with access to credit and access to tools that are designed to improve their financial lives, not make them worse. The process is 100% digital, with no bureaucracy involved; it claims to be fast, and the rates are lower than those of traditional banks. Clearly, the need is there. An estimated 52% of the population use credit to pay for basic expenses, creating an unsecured consumer credit market of about $200 billion, of which about 70% is in revolving credit. As a result, 62 million Brazilians have overdue accounts or missed payments. Open Co wants to give Brazilian people more options, and so far, the people seem to be welcoming those options with well, open arms.  There is a lot of buzz around “buy now, pay later” nowadays, but the truth is — its execs point out — that it has always existed in Brazil, a country where people usually buy things in installments with their credit cards. Looking ahead, the Open Co team is refreshingly transparent regarding financials. To get even more specific, the team is projecting to reach nearly $196 million in revenues in 2022, a “3x” growth compared to 2021. It also aims to allow its customers to access over $616 million in financing in 2022.  Execs say that its business is profitable, but it is still heavily investing in growth and building better products and technology, which causes its cash requirements to be above the cash produced by operations. Combining the results of its two predecessors, Open Co says it has helped consumers save more than $500 million in interest expenses over the years and has been increasingly establishing partnerships with merchants, retailers and service providers to be closer to its clients’ point of need when requesting credit. Overall, it has provided nearly $405 million in credit to more than 200,000 people so far.   A few factors are working in Open Co’s favor, its team believes. “We have a huge market with complacent incumbents, a population that adopts technologies early on and a supportive regulatory agenda. Last year we saw the creation of Pix, an instant payments system that allows people to transfer money in a few seconds, for free; and this year the implementation of open banking, which will reduce information asymmetry between incumbents and fintechs, started as well,” said Open Co co-founder Rafael Pereira. The company plans to use its new capital toward its expansion plans, with “significant investments” in technology and product development. Naturally, it will also be doing some hiring. The company currently has 230 employees, more than 50% of whom work in tech and product.  “When it comes to plans for the future, we can say that we want to give credit to people who have overdue accounts,” Pereira added. “But we don’t want to do the traditional way, with high interest rates that make it difficult for people to pay. Our mission is to break this vicious cycle.” Felipe Fujiwara, investment leader of SoftBank Latin America Fund, said that SoftBank is most excited about Open Co’s “large” opportunity to improve the quality of Brazilians’ financial lives through credit. “Difficulty in accessing credit is one of the biggest social issues in Brazil. More than half of Brazilians are obliged to ask for credit to pay their basic expenses, and the result of the combination of demand and high interest results in 62 million people being denied credit,” Fujiwara wrote via email.  The company, he added, has a track record in underwriting personal loans and in raising debt funding to provide better credit alternatives to consumers. At the same time, it offers merchants “the ability to meaningfully increase traffic, order value, conversion and GMV.” “Besides that, it was the first fintech to use artificial intelligence to analyze customers, helping to solve the country’s credit problem, which has one of the highest spreads in the world,” Fujiwara added.

2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/innovaccer-valued-at-3-2-billion-in-150-million-funding/","Innovaccer valued at $3.2 billion in $150 million funding","","Innovaccer has raised a new financing round and more than doubled its valuation to $3.2 billion from $1.3 billion in February this year as a growing number of healthcare organizations move to use the San Francisco-headquartered firm’s platform to put their troves of data to better use. Mubadala Capital led the $150 million Series E round, pushing the startup’s all-time raise to over $375 million. Whale Rock Capital, Avidity Partners, OMERS Growth Equity, Dragoneer and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, as well as existing investors including Tiger Global, B Capital Group, Microsoft’s M12 fund and Steadview Capital also participated in the round. In the past two decades, most industries have adopted technology to bring efficiencies to their businesses and accelerate their growth. The healthcare industry, in comparison, has been the last frontier to adopt technology in many ways, said Abhinav Shashank, co-founder and chief executive of Innovaccer, in an interview with TechCrunch. “We haven’t been able to drive that kind of transformation. Moreover, most systems that have been built for this space are non-cloud,” he said, adding that this has resulted in troves of data sitting in siloed systems. That’s where Innovaccer comes into play. The startup, which began its journey in India, has developed a cloud software layer that works on top of the existing systems employed by healthcare facilities and enables patients’ data to be fetched and analysis performed on. Healthcare facilities “don’t need to replace their existing systems. Our cloud layer connects with a number of their existing electronic health record systems,” said Shashank. Getting better access enables patients to supply and make use of even more data — such as insurance or medical data generated by fitness trackers — they have on themselves. “This creates a 360-degree view of the patient.” Moreover, this allows doctors to get deeper and real-time visibility into the patient’s health status. The B2B-focused startup has amassed over 50 customers, including Banner Health and Roche in the U.S. Some of its recently signed customers include One Medical, CommonSpirit, Sentara, Adventist Health, Children’s Health Alliance, Florence Health and Zus Health.  Innovaccer founders Kanav Hasija (left), Abhinav Shashank and Sandeep Gupta. Image Credits: Innovaccer As things stand today, when a hospital or any other health facility works with Innovaccer, its patients’ data remains with that facility. Other healthcare providers don’t get access to that data. This is one of the challenges that many entrepreneurs are hoping to solve. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, for instance, is hoping that his blockchain network will become a universal standard to a point that any patient anywhere in the world will be able to quickly grant permission to a doctor to view his or her records in an event of an emergency. But we are not there yet. Shashank suggested that in the coming years, as healthcare providers begin to open up, they may agree to a universal protocol and such an interoperable system would then work. One of the reasons he is optimistic is the growing interest of big tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Apple in the health tech space. “They want us to succeed and we are building systems that run on top of their clouds. So there’s massive synergies in how we are all approaching the market,” he said. The startup, which signed its first customer in 2016, has grown rapidly in recent years, he said. “Our focus has been the U.S. market. At some point, we will expand internationally as well. But given the size of the problem we have on our hands in the U.S. itself, we will remain largely focused here for the near term.” The growth of Innovaccer is one of the biggest Indian SaaS success stories. Shashank, pointing to the success of many SaaS startups that began their journey in India, Australia or Southeast Asia, said for SaaS entrepreneurs, the “world has never been flatter as the delivery model is on the cloud. I don’t think it has ever been easier for entrepreneurs to build a global software company of significant size and scale,” he said. Innovaccer will deploy the fresh funds to supercharge its research and development work and also hire more talent across product, engineering and customer experience roles. “We have been investors in Innovaccer since 2019, and believe that the company has all the necessary pillars to define the new gold standard of how the Health Cloud should be implemented by providers, payers, and life science companies,” said Alaa Halawa, partner and head of the U.S. Ventures business at Mubadala Capital, in a statement. “Hundreds of tech companies have tried to create a common data framework to connect the healthcare industry, but they all fell short due to extreme industry complexities or technology challenges. But in five short years, Innovaccer has built the most successful data activation platform in the healthcare industry as proven by record rates of industry adoption. Innovaccer is likely the first and only company since the invention of the electronic health record (EHR) that has the opportunity to unify the healthcare ecosystem.” Can API vendors solve healthcare’s data woes?

2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/more-funding-for-israels-saas-security-startups-as-atmosec-raises-6-million-seed-round/","More funding for Israel’s SaaS security startups as Atmosec raises $6 million seed round","","Israeli SaaS security startup Atmosec today announced having raised a $6 million seed round led by Israeli VC firm Glilot Capital Partners and American fund Battery Ventures. Its team had previously participated in Intel Ignite’s fourth Tel Aviv startup acceleration cohort. Now out of stealth mode, Atmosec wants to make it more secure for companies to use a flurry of cloud SaaS solutions, from Slack to ServiceNow. Its solution focuses on anomaly detection based on automatic monitoring to notify clients of potential issues and prevent attacks. Quoting data from Statista, Atmosec points out that the number of SaaS apps used by organizations is on the rise, with an average of 110 in 2021. This makes sense, but also poses security challenges, as many of them “have inadequate systems to manage third-party risk,” said Adi Dangot Zukovsky of Battery Ventures. This is where Atmosec comes in, Dangot Zukovsky explained, “with new technology that provides cloud-native enterprises with greater visibility into their existing systems and helps them lower the risk of outsiders exploiting their third-party business applications and app-to-app connectivity paths.” Atmosec’s seed round counted participation from other Israeli entrepreneurs in the security space, such as Wiz‘s CEO Assaf Rappaport, Talon Cyber’s CEO Ofer Ben-Noon and Armis’ co-founders Yevgeny Dibrov and Nadir Izrael. Co-founders Aner Gelman, Misha Seltzer and Shaked Gitelman are themselves former executives at Armis, which recently raised $300 million to expand beyond IoT. There’s additional connection between the two startups, Gelman said: “We’re leveraging some of the technologies and concepts that we helped build out at Armis, and without giving away too many trade secrets, we’re utilizing continuous machine learning with baseline analysis that identifies anomalies in connections based on actual and potential behavior, not just configurations.” With Gelman and his two co-founders all being army intelligence veterans, it is not too surprising that there’s a bit of secrecy involved. The TL;DR is that understanding the behavior helps Atmosec detect anomalies its clients need to address. But now that the company is out of stealth, it is likely that it will start sharing a bit more with its potential users on how it differentiates from competitors. Having recently learned that fellow Israeli SaaS security startups Grip Security and Adaptive Shield had respectively raised $19 million and $30 million Series A rounds, respectively, this is definitely a hot space we are keen to learn more about."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/papaya-raises-50-million-to-give-you-a-way-to-pay-bills-via-its-mobile-app/","Papaya raises $50M to give you a way to pay bills via its mobile app","","Paying bills is hardly a fun thing. So I think it’s safe to say that any technology that can make the process easier is welcome by all. Papaya is a Los Angeles-based startup with a mission to do just that. It has developed technology to give people a way to pay bills outside of traditional methods, such as through the mail, over the phone or via a Web portal. The company’s mobile application lets users take a photo of any bill and then its artificial intelligence-powered “bill-understanding technology” makes sure it gets paid (after a user has provided payment details, of course). To prove the point, CEO and co-founder Patrick Kann demonstrated for me via Zoom how even after tearing up a bill into a few pieces, Papaya’s app was able to scan the pertinent parts of the invoice to make sure it was paid. “As long as a biller has an electronic payment method, anyone can submit payments through our app,” Kann said. “It’s a true universal payment method.” Kann was inspired to start Papaya after growing up in Brazil, where a similar payment technology already exists.  “People back home were surprised to find out we didn’t have the same capabilities here,” Kann said. “In this respect, the U.S. has been an anomaly, with only 3% of bills being paid by a mobile device. We saw a huge business opportunity with mobile bill payments.” Kann teamed up with computer vision scientist Jason Meltzer, who led development for the computer vision technology behind the Roomba at iRobot, to build Papaya. The goal of the company is simple: minimize Americans’ bill pay stress by making it easy to pay any bill with their mobile device. It also claims to help businesses of all sizes in all industries as well as governments and municipalities get paid faster and more often. Today, Papaya is announcing it has raised $50 million in a Series B round of funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Sequoia Capital, Acrew Capital, 01 Advisors, Mucker Capital, Fika Ventures, F-Prime and Sound Ventures. The financing brings the previously under-the-radar company’s total raised to $65 million since its 2016 inception. Papaya currently facilitates payments for “hundreds of thousands” of businesses and organizations and millions of users in the U.S. Beyond the mobile app, the company integrates with partners’ billing processes through embedded widget technologies and paper statements. It’s hoping to build on its existing technology with an extensive product roadmap.  Image Credits: Papaya Papaya has already come a long way. In its early days, Kann promoted the app by putting stickers with Papaya’s QR code on people’s windshields after they got a parking ticket in Las Vegas. Over time, the city added it to their paper notices. Then, the company began working with doctor’s offices to offer the option to their patients. Kann prides himself on an 80-person staff that is made up 60% of underrepresented minorities, and a product engineering team that is 45% female.  So far, its growth has been “completely organic,” with no marketing team, according to the CEO. “Our cost of customer acquisition is very low relative to a lot of fintechs,” he said. But of course, part of its capital will go toward building awareness and growing its headcount. While Kann declined to reveal revenue specifics, he did say Papaya “is on track to acquiring 1 million new active users per year.” Speaking of revenue, the company’s model is interesting. The app is free for users, and Papaya doesn’t ask for anything “extra” from merchants. Rather, it earns a percentage of revenue from interchange fees that merchants have to pay when they process credit cards. Bessemer Venture Partners’ Charles Birnbaum says his firm has been following the Papaya team since it first used its “magical” bill pay app for themselves. “It’s incredibly rare to come across a business that is not only positively impacting millions of consumers by making something painful more seamless but also solving a critical pain point for businesses within several different verticals spanning from healthcare to utilities,” he said. “We have no doubt that the Papaya bill pay experience will become table stakes throughout the consumer financial services landscape in the years to come.”"
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/grindr-final-gdpr-fine/","Grindr’s $7M GDPR fine is a stark warning to adtech not to track","Consent breaches","Grindr, a hook-up app for gay, bi, trans and queer people, has been fined around $7.1 million (65 million NOK) by Norway’s data protection authority for passing user data to advertisers without consent — including highly sensitive information related to users’ sexual orientation. Specifically, the DPA found that Grindr breached Articles 6(1) and 9(1) of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The complaint adds to the behavioral advertising industry’s legal woes — which continue to pile up in the region. The final size of the penalty Grindr has been hit with is a little reduced versus the 100 million NOK/$12.1 million that the gay dating app was facing back in January — when the Datatilsynet issued a preliminary decision on the case. The authority told TechCrunch the smaller sanction takes account of the company having lower turnover in reality than the “rough estimate” it had relied upon in January when issuing the preliminary fine. It also said the reduction takes account of measures Grindr implemented since the complaint was filed with the aim of bringing its processing of personal data in line with GDPR’s requirements. The DPA’s decision notes that the final fine is approximately 32% of the maximum amount possible. And because GDPR allows for fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of an entity’s total global turnover in the preceding year, whichever is higher, it suggests the U.S.-based app’s annual revenue does not exceed €20 million/$22.5 million. The DPA describes the size of the fine as “proportionate both to the severity of the infringement and to Grindr’s financial situation”, asserting that it “does not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives pursued by the GDPR in the present case”. The complaint has taken almost a year to arrive at a final decision owing — at least in part — to Grindr requesting extensions to deadlines on a number of occasions. It’s also worth noting that this investigation was limited to the process Grindr used to obtain consent at the time of the complaint — in 2019 and up to April 2020 (when it switched to a different method). So the lawfulness of Grindr’s current method for obtaining consent has not been investigated. While the decision does not include any requirements that Grindr (or its ad partners) delete unlawfully obtained user data, the DPA told us that that could change in future. It also confirmed that its investigation against Grindr’s ad partners (who it sent user data to) is ongoing. “Our decision does not include any erasure requirements at this time but we have also made it clear that further decisions may come at a later date if we deem it necessary,” said Tobias Judin, director for international issues at Datatilsynet. “In other words: We are not ruling out any possibilities for further enforcement at this stage.” “Now that we have a final decision in the Grindr case, this decision will also inform those investigations,” he further confirmed of the ad partner probes.  The penalty for Grindr tracking users without consent comes at a time when some EU lawmakers continue pressing for a ban on surveillance-based advertising — although a committee vote in the European Parliament this week did not back amending the Digital Services Act to include an outright ban on surveillance-based advertising, as some MEPs have been pressing for. The committee did back a prohibition on dark patterns to manipulate consent, though. So legal requirements look set to continue to tighten around how adtech can operate in the EU — and reform of manipulative defaults is being enforced. See also: The U.K.’s data watchdog’s recent warned to the industry that the end of tracking is nigh. In a statement welcoming Norway’s GDPR slap-down of Grindr, the deputy DG of the European Consumer Organisation, BEUC, Ursula Pachl, said: “Grindr illegally exploited and shared its users’ information for targeted advertising, including sensitive information about their sexual orientation. It is high time the behavioural advertising industry stops tracking and profiling consumers 24/7. It is a business model which clearly breaches the EU’s data protection rules and harms consumers. Let’s now hope this is the first domino to fall and that authorities start imposing fines on other companies as the infringements identified in this decision are standard surveillance ad-tech industry practices.” Dating and fertility apps among those snitching to ‘out of control’ ad tech, report finds  Datatilsynet opened the investigation into Grindr after receiving complaints from Norway’s Consumer Council (NCC) and the European privacy campaign group, noyb, acting on behalf an individual complainant. Last year the NCC published an analysis of data flows from a number of popular apps (including Grindr but also a number of others) showing how they share data with “unexpected third parties”, including entities in the behavioral ad industry to highlight the extent of adtech’s lawfulness problem. In its response to the data protection watchdog’s investigation, Grindr had claimed it had users’ consent to share their data with its advertising partners — which included Twitter-owned MoPub, Xandr (previously AppNexus), OpenX, AdColony and Smaato. However the app did not offer users a free choice over whether to agree to its terms or not. If a Grindr user declined to accept its privacy policy during onboarding they were unable to proceed to use the app. And while Grindr went on to change how it gathers consent — implementing a consent management platform provided by the third party OneTrust in April 2020 — as noted above this complaint focuses on how the app was obtaining consent prior to that switch. The GDPR states that for consent to be a valid legal basis to process personal data it must be informed, specific and freely given (emphasis ours). So the lack of a choice offered to users looks like a very flagrant breach of the rules. In seeking to avoid a sanction, Grindr also sought to argue that it did not pass information on individual users’ sexuality to advertisers — claiming it only sent generic keywords (such as “gay”, “bi” and “bi-curious”). This is important because GDPR has specific rules for so-called “special category data” — requiring an even higher bar of explicit consent from a user if that’s the legal basis you’re claiming for processing information such as a person’s sexual orientation. In reaching its final decision on the complaint, the Datatilsynet concluded that protections contained in Article 9 of the GDPR (which concerns “special category data”) should not be so narrowly interpreted. “Being a Grindr user strongly indicates, and appears in most cases to accurately reflect, that the data subject belongs to a sexual minority. Furthermore, the fact that a data subject belongs to a sexual minority may lead to prejudice and discrimination even without revealing their specific sexual orientation,” it writes, adding: “The wording of Article 9 does not require a revealing of a particular ‘sexual orientation’, and the purpose behind Article 9 discourages a narrow interpretation. “For these reasons, we find that information that a data subject is a Grindr user is data ‘concerning’ the data subject’s ‘sexual orientation’.” Grindr had also sought to suggest that advertisers were unlikely to use categories of special category data for profiling and ad targeting — telling the DPA it would be surprised if that were the case. Which is — to put it mildly — a surprising argument to try to make, given ample evidence from other GDPR complaints of the highly invasive profiling being carried out by the behavioral ad industry. Not to mention the fact that a flagship industry framework that’s widely used to claim consent to process people’s data for ad targeting is facing a GDPR breach finding itself. As is the online advertising body that controls it. IAB Europe says it’s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR  In any case, Datatilsynet rejected Grindr’s dodge — pointing out that it’s irrelevant how such sensitive data might be further processed, since — under GDPR — “the sharing of personal data concerning a natural person’s ‘sexual orientation’ to advertising partners is sufficient to trigger Article 9”. (Its decision also makes it explicit that it does “not agree with the claim that a data subject’s ‘sexual orientation’ is not a category of data that could potentially be used by advertisers to target ads”.) In another attempt to wiggle out of a GDPR slap-down, Grindr had also sought to argue that even if its advertisers — theoretically — received any sensitive personal data they must “blind” themselves to, per commitments in its contracts with advertisers. Moreover it claimed many adtech companies operating in the EU have spent the last decade or so devising so-called “blinding methods” which it said obfuscate which app an ad call is coming from. “Grindr holds that participants in the ad tech ecosystem would likely only receive a ‘blinded’ app-ID and not the corresponding app name,” the DPA explains in the decision. “According to Grindr, it is a common practice in the EU for ad networks to nullify the app name and use a random App ID in the ad call so that downstream bidders are ‘blind’ to the actual name of the app where the ad is to be served.” However, once again, the DPA points out this is irrelevant — given sensitive data being passed is enough to trigger Article 9 provisions. The Datatilsynet’s decision also cites a technical report, by Mnemonic, which showed Grindr’s app name being shared with MoPub — “who further shared this within their mediation network”. And further notes that Mnemonic’s report also showed the app name was shared from Grindr to “multiple other advertising partners”. As if that wasn’t enough, Datatilsynet further points out that Grindr’s own privacy policy “explicitly states that ‘[o]ur advertising partners are aware that such data is being transmitted from Grindr’.” So, er,…. <U+0001F974> (NB: In a further demolition of the self-serving notion of “blinded” app-IDs, the DPA goes on to make the point that even if this were happening as claimed by the adtech industry it still wouldn’t comply with other requirements in the GDPR, noting: “Even if some advertising partners or other participants in the ad tech ecosystem would ‘blind’ themselves or only receive an obfuscated app ID, this is not line with the principle of accountability in Article 5(2) GDPR. Grindr would have to rely on the action of advertising partners or other participants in the ad tech ecosystem to halt its sharing of the data in question.”) The DPA’s analysis goes further in unpicking adtech’s obfuscating claims vs what’s really being done with people’s data vs what EU law actually requires. (So it’s well worth reading in full if you’re interested in devilish detail.) The long and short of it is that Datatilsynet found Grindr did process users’ sexual orientation data, as set out in Article 9(1) — by “sharing personal data on a specific user alongside app name or app ID to advertising partners”. And while the GDPR can allow for consent-based processing of special category data a higher bar of “explicit” consent is required for that type of processing to be lawful, again, the DPA found that Grindr had not obtained the required legal standard of permission from users. Its decision further concludes that Grindr users had not “manifestly made public” information about their sexual orientation simply by merit of using the app, as the app had sought to argue (noting, for example, that it allows for an anonymous approach, letting users select a nickname and choose whether or not to upload a selfie). “At any rate, it goes beyond the reasonable expectations of the data subject that Grindr would disclose information concerning their sexual orientation to advertising partners. Though information about someone merely being a Grindr user must be considered a special category of personal data under Article 9(1), becoming a Grindr user is not an affirmative act by the data subject to make the information public,” Datatilsynet adds. Grindr has been contacted for comment on the sanction. Update: The app has now responded — sending a statement attributed to Shane Wiley, its chief privacy officer, who writes: We strongly disagree with Datatilsynet’s reasoning, which concerns historical consent practices from years ago, not our current consent practices or Privacy Policy. Even though Datatilsynet has lowered the fine compared to their earlier letter, Datatilsynet relies on a series of flawed findings, introduces many untested legal perspectives, and the proposed fine is therefore still entirely out of proportion with those flawed findings. Grinder has three weeks to lodge an appeal against the decision — if it wishes to do so. Per Wiley, the company is currently “analyzing” the Datatilsynet’s decision, which he said it had “just” received, adding that it is “considering its options including the right to appeal the findings to the Personvernnemnda (PVN – Appeal Board)”. In further remarks attributed to Wiley, Grindr added: Since launching in 2009, Grindr has grown into the preeminent mobile social networking platform for the LGBTQ+ community. We safely connect millions of daily adult users in almost every country in the world and enable them to discover, share, and navigate their community and their world. Protecting our users’ interests and ensuring that we put them in control of their personal data have always been our top priorities. We have also been proactive in adopting industry-leading privacy positions and tools, like detailed consent flows, granular user privacy controls, and ‘just-in-time’ app notifications. Datatilsynet’s order is careful to specify that there may be additional issues related to Grindr’s prior or current consent mechanism since this investigation was limited to the scope of the complaints which were focused on the lawfulness of its previous consent management platform in the app. “The fact that potential issues have fallen outside the scope of our investigation does not preclude those issues from being investigated in the future,” its decision notes. In a statement commenting on the decision, Ala Krinickyte, a data protection lawyer at noyb, described it as “astonishing that the DPA has to convince Grindr that its users are LGBT+ and that this fact is not a commodity to be bartered”. Krinickyte further summarized the Datatilsynet order thusly: “You cannot share personal data with a potentially unlimited number of partners without being able to control what happens to that data.” And that is really the crux of the problem for surveillance-based advertising which relies upon pervasive tracking of Internet users to individually target marketing. Even setting aside the existential problem of a lack of consent for tracking, the adtech industry does not have processes in place to control what happens to data once it’s grabbed and “shared” with scores of faceless adtech entities involved in the high velocity programmatic auction process known as real-time bidding (RTB). GPDR complaints targeting RTB’s failure to adequately protect people’s data have been sitting, unenforced, on EU regulators’ desks for years — but there are signs that the enforcement blockage is starting to shift, not least as a result of smart, smaller-scale actions such as Norway going after Grindr. The web of adtech data flows is such a tangled one that even a relative bit player can draw in and implicate scores of others. The adtech industry’s workaround for people’s general distaste at being stalked and creeped on through their devices and digital activity, meanwhile, has been to not actually ask for permission to track and profile them in the first place. But — in Europe at least — that mocking “consent” pantomime is finally headed for its end-game. Whether the alternative targeting processes the industry devises will be just as cynical, manipulative and exploitative as what they’ve been doing for the past decade+ will largely depend upon regulators and lawmakers driving proper oversight of a sector that’s been allowed to flourish in the dark, rife with dark patterns and defined by its dark arts. One negative signal is how the IAB Europe continues to try to confuse the issue by conflating ad targeting with invasive tracking — in a bid to lobby MEPs not to outlaw surveillance-based adtech. In reality, privacy-safe targeting alternatives already exist (such as contextual ads) and have been profitable for years for companies like DuckDuckGo. The behavioral advertising industry’s lawfulness problem is in fact directly chainlinked to its mass surveillance of Internet users. Commenting on the Datatilsynet’s decision against Grindr in a statement, Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy in the NCC, warned: “This sends a strong signal to all companies involved in commercial surveillance. There are serious repercussions to sharing personal data without a legal basis. We call for the digital advertising industry to make fundamental changes to respect consumers’ rights.” NB: While Norway is not an EU Member it is part of the European Economic Area and it transposed the GDPR into national law in 2018. Additionally, Grindr being a US company without a defined legal entity in the EU opens its business to regulatory oversight by DPAs in any part of the bloc which have concerns (and where it offers a service), rather than oversight being funnelled via gatekeepers like Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, as has happened with complaints against Google’s adtech for example Grindr on the hook for €10M over GDPR consent violations  Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads   "
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/swimply-raises-40m/","Swimply raises $40M from Airbnb and Lime co-founders, VCs for its online pool marketplace","","The concept of creating a marketplace for underutilized assets that can turn into a meaningful business for hosts is not a new one. And there is no higher profile of how successful that model can be than Airbnb. So it’s no surprise that one of Airbnb’s most prominent investors, GGV Capital, is now backing another startup with a similar model. But rather than putting properties on a marketplace, Swimply came up with the idea of pairing homeowners with pools with people who want private access to them. And so far, business is going swimmingly.  To keep things flowing (couldn’t resist), the startup has just raised $40 million in a funding round led by Mayfield — just seven months after announcing a $10 million financing. Besides Mayfield and GGV, other backers include Conrad Shang and Collin West at Ensemble Ventures and a high-profile list of validating angel investors including Airbnb co-founder Nate Blecharczyk; Casey Winters, formely of Pinterest and Grubhub; Lime co-founder Brad Bao; Rob Chestnut, former chief ethics officer at Airbnb and eBay; Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Shef’s Alvin Salehi. They join existing backers Norwest Venture Partners and Trust Ventures. The way it works is pretty straightforward. Swimply connects homeowners that have underutilized backyard spaces and pools with people seeking a way to gather, cool off or exercise, for example. People or families can rent pools by the hour at an average price of $45 to $65 per hour, depending on the amenities.  In May, co-founder Bunim Laskin told TechCrunch that Swimply was seeing “seven digits a month in revenue” and 15,000 to 20,000 reservations a month.  Over the past six months alone, Swimply has seen 3x growth. In the last year, its site facilitated 250,000 bookings, up from 40,000 all of last year — up more than six times. In 2021, it put 1 million people in 15,000 pools across 103 cities.  So while the company declined to reveal its revenues, if it gets a cut of each of those bookings, well, that’s not insignificant. (It charges a 10% guest service fee that it says helps cover insurance support as well as a 15% commission fee from the owner.) The surge in demand surprised even co-founders Laskin (who came up with the idea for the company when he was just 20) and Asher Weinberger.  Image Credits: Swimply “In 2020, we booked a lot of smaller groups. But this year, with people getting vaccinated [against COVID], we saw more birthday parties being celebrated, swimming lessons coming back and people getting together again for the first time in a while,” Laskin told TechCrunch.   Now the company is looking to expand beyond pools to outdoor spaces in general. In 2022, it plans to match people with other “passion” spaces, such as underutilized hot tubs, tennis courts, large backyard spaces, rooftops and even one day…indoor gyms. This leads to an indirect sustainability component in that actually using underutilized spaces instead of building new ones that comes with discouraging new construction. Swimply is also proud of the fact that it is spawning entrepreneurs. Like Airbnb, Swimply’s hosts have the potential to make big bucks, according to Laskin. In 2020, the highest-earning host earned a little over $20,000. This year, there were hosts that earned over six figures. In fact, the top 20% of hosts earned around $5,000 per month, Laskin said. “This is turning a lot of people into solopreneurs,” Laskin said. That’s part of the reason Swimply is using some of its new capital to build new tools for its hosts to help them better manage their businesses. As proof of that, some hosts are taking things a step further and doing things like installing vending machines on their properties or offering chef’s services to their guests. The company also plans to scale up support, insurance and, as mentioned previously, launch new verticals. Some fun stats about the business we found interesting: Twenty percent of Swimply’s revenue comes from the Los Angeles market. Next up of popular markets are: Austin, Texas; Portland, Oregon; New York City and Maryland. Sixty percent of the bookings are made by families. The average reservation is two hours long. Repeat reservations make up about 72% of bookings. Mayfield Managing Director Navin Chaddha notes that his team has “big believers in the sharing economy,” as evidenced not only by its leading this round, but by the firm’s investments another sharing economy startups such as Lyft and Poshmark. The pool market, in particular, is appealing because swimming is one of the top activities for families but very few people have access to pools. “Swimply’s mission is to democratize ownership of recreational spaces and to allow hosts to share underutilized assets for their local communities, starting with swimming pools,” he said. “I’m very, very excited about partnering with Swimply and helping the world get equalized, and not only the rich having access to these amenities.” The combination of the market opportunity with mission-oriented founders was a big draw for Chaddha. “Swimply has seen exploding growth, and we believe the market is much bigger than swimming pools, which in and of itself is a $52 billion market,” he told TechCrunch. “They have the potential to do with Airbnb, Lyft and Poshmark for this constituency. It was a no-brainer to lead a $40 million round for this company.” GGV Managing Partner Hans Tung and Principal Robin Li were drawn to Swimply for many of the same reasons that Mayfield was. For Li, the prospect of giving people easier and more private access to outdoor spaces is huge. “This is the country club reinvented and even revolutionizing what the YMCA will be like in the future,” she said. “At most of these places, there are so many restrictions on what you can wear, and what you can do. There are so many hurdles to book a place, even in your local neighborhood.” The fact that Swimply has so many repeat users is evidence of how easy the experience is, in her view. Tung sees a number of parallels between Airbnb and Swimply’s models. But one big difference, he points out, is the frequency at which people travel compared to going swimming or merely spending time outdoors. “Swimming is more everyday use and a higher frequency of usage, which makes the platform extremely interesting,” he told TechCrunch. For hosts too, this can be more lucrative, since you are able to rent the same space more than once a day, multiple times a week. “Frequency usage is a lot higher than any travel site,” he said. “So like TikTok and Poshmark, Swimply is allowing more everyday people to monetize, and empowering more merchants.” How 4 New Jersey pools turned into a startup that just raised $10M "

It plans to use the funds to continue building out its AI platform to bring in more diversified data sources, in order to extract insights across an ever-wider range of business questions that a person might ask. “Organizations still don’t have an effective radar to get ahead of threats and opportunities, and turning challenges into opportunities,” said David Benigson, the startup’s CEO, in an interview. They aggregate hundreds of sources of data — from social and news media through to 25,000 podcasts, regulatory filings and other public records — into a single platform. It then applies machine learning and other AI techniques to extract insights from it all based on natural language questions posed by Signal AI customers. “We’ve been diversifying the data that we inject in the platform,” he added. Signal AI currently works across some 100 languages. The funding is coming in the form of a Series D, and it is being led by Highland Europe, with new backer abrdn plus previous backers Redline (which led Signal AI’s Series C in 2019), MMC and strategic backers Hearst and Guardian Media Group Ventures also participating. London-based Signal AI has now raised $100 million. It is not disclosing its valuation, but Benigson — who co-founded the company with Miguel Martinez, the company’s chief data scientist — said it grew 100% over the last round. PitchBook estimates that valuation was around $100 million at that point (in 2019), which would put it at $200 million now, if that figure is accurate. In any case, Signal AI itself has definitely grown. Benigson said that the startup now works with 40% of the Fortune 500, with its customer base including Deloitte, Bank of America and Google. The challenge that Signal has identified and is building to fix is one that we all encounter every day, but feels particularly acute when it involves businesses navigating tricky issues with potentially billions of dollars of investment at stake if they take the wrong turn. The internet has equipped us with a vast trove of information, but not always the best keys and maps for unlocking and getting around it, especially when the answers we are looking for are not straightforward, as they are in the case of more fluffy questions around sentiment analysis, or “answers” that are actually a collation of information from a number of sources. There are a number of companies that have also identified this gap and are building to solve it, including Dataminr (which raised a huge round this year at $4.1 billion valuation), Meltwater (publicly traded and also acquiring businesses to build out its technology muscle) and Cision (now privately held and also making big acquisitions to grow). Much of the emphasis and impetus for these companies started and still sits squarely in the area of media monitoring — a huge business tapped not just by other media sources but by companies themselves. Indeed, Signal AI itself used to be called Signal Media and focused mainly on this area as well. That in itself is still a big market that is worth disrupting — the old-school way of approaching this was to collate media clippings, provided to clients; the new approach is not just to collate mentions but to deliver more summarized information and insights gleaned from those clips. The more the internet grows, the more clips there will be, and so in fact simply getting a pile of them becomes untenable for even the most enthusiastic teams of communications specialists. Even so, that model set up for more intelligent media monitoring also paves the way for applying the same format and algorithms to a much wider set of use cases, which is the premise Signal AI has been building upon. A large part of its work, thus, still remains focused on providing insights to people working around communications strategy, but it’s deepening the types of information it can provide to them by way of its AIQ platform (as Signal calls it). Benigson notes that this now includes, for example, more information and “insights” for a company on potential business partners; getting up to speed on an aspect of diversity and inclusion and how it’s being approached by others; a pending decision on environmental strategy; and data to inform a company’s strategy on regulatory compliance in areas like taxes or data protection. While comparisons to companies like Dataminr are fair, Benigson said, Signal AI differs from these as it provides more context both in the kinds of queries that can be asked by users, and in the responses that are given. Alongside its business growth, that richer experience is another reason why investors are interested in seeing how the startup will grow. “Signal AI is a stand out category defining business” said Tony Zappalà, a partner at Highland Europe, in a statement. “We are excited to be involved with the next chapter of the company’s innovative growth. David and the leadership team have a clear vision for the decision augmentation category they are helping to define and as Gartner’s research has shown, the opportunity is huge.”"
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-350-million-at-3-billion-valuation/","Crypto company Anchorage raises $350 million at $3 billion valuation","","Less than a year after raising an $80 million Series C round, Anchorage is announcing that it has raised a $350 million Series D round. With today’s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of more than $3 billion. Anchorage offers a custody solution for big institutions, such as publicly traded companies or funds. On top of that, Anchorage lets you trade crypto assets, stake assets to earn returns and participate in protocol governance if you own a lot of tokens for a specific protocol. For instance, one transaction has been particularly commented. Back in August, Visa acquired a CryptoPunk for 49.5 ETH. At the time, it represented around $150,000. Behind the scenes, Anchorage handled the transaction for Visa. KKR is leading the round, with many, many different investors also participating. So take a deep breath and try to read this sentence out loud in one try: Goldman Sachs, Alameda Research, Andreessen Horowitz, Apollo credit funds, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Blockchain Capital, Delta Blockchain Fund, Elad Gil, GIC, GoldenTree Asset Management, Innovius Capital, Kraken, Lux Capital, PayPal Ventures, Senator Investment Group, Standard Investments, Thoma Bravo and Wellington Management. You may wonder why such a big group of investors want to put some money in Anchorage. That’s because Anchorage received a federal banking charter, turning it into a digital asset bank. It differentiates Anchorage from many custodian products out there. With today’s funding round, the company plans to improve its product, especially for global financial firms and other fintech companies. Customers can also expect more features with more integrations with DeFi products. “As a pioneer in enabling institutional investors to access digital assets, Anchorage has built a best in class, institutional grade digital asset platform that combines the best practices of both modern security and usability. We are thrilled to lead this Series D round and work with Diogo, Nathan and their talented team as they continue to support the institutional adoption of digital assets through their differentiated, regulated and integrated suite of solutions,” KKR’s Technology Growth Equity senior leader Ben Pederson said in a statement. Over the past year, Anchorage has increased its number of clients by 96%. The company’s head count has also increased by quite a lot with a 175% jump compared to the same period last year. With its federal banking charter, Anchorage has a good barrier to entry in case other companies want to compete in the same space. As companies realize that crypto assets are more than a fad, they’ll increasingly look for trustworthy partners to interact with the crypto ecosystem. And some of them will certainly end up working with Anchorage. Disclosure: I own small amounts of various cryptocurrencies. The crypto rich find security in Anchorage "
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/pabio-seed-plus-german-expansion/","Furniture rental company Pabio expands to Germany","","If you think of Pabio as “Stitchfix for furniture, in Europe,” you’re probably pretty close to the mark. The company started in Switzerland a couple of years ago with a mission to stop people from buying disposable Ikea stuff for a two-year stint in an apartment, replacing it with well-styled, well-thought-out interior design suggestions and robust, reusable and recyclable furniture. Today it announced it expanded into Germany and raised a drawer-full of cash to expand its marketing and to reach into additional European countries. With Pabio, customers can request a personalized interior design proposal with photorealistic renders of what their fully furnished apartment will look like. They upload a floor plan and take some photos, and Pabio generates a 3D model of their apartment, furniture and all. If the customer likes it, they can subscribe to their furniture, delivered, installed and insured, for a monthly subscription fee. “Most people would not pay for an Airbnb if it looks like the apartment they live in. We figured maybe there’s something there. We got into the interior design and furniture space,” explains Carlo Badini, co-founder and CEO of Pabio. “We came up with the idea of marrying interior design with furniture subscription to make nice living affordable to those who rent only for a couple of years.” “Ikea — just like the furniture industry in general — it tries to portray itself as sustainable, but most furniture is never recycled. The business model for ‘fast furniture’ is ‘how much can we sell and how frequently’. In our case, it’s the exact opposite. Because we offer a subscription, we’re motivated to keep your stuff in your apartment as long as possible, which means we offer high-quality stuff that can last for decades,” says Anand Chowdhary, CTO at Pabio. “Furniture used to be high quality. If you go to your grandparents’ house, you see that the dining table is 20 years old. That was the point of furniture before fast furniture became a trend. We are a new take on that same idea — that furniture should be long-lasting.” “When you get to the end of your subscription, and you move away, we would take all the furniture back. We will refurbish it and put it in a new apartment. That means we’re optimizing that whole process of how quickly can we put the furniture into a new apartment at a discounted price,” says Badini. “Three or four cycles later, when that furniture is actually fully worn down, we would recycle it.” The pricing for the service is aimed to be reasonably competitive compared to buying your own furniture — a one-bedroom apartment, fully furnished, lands in the sub-€200 (US$225) range per month, often significantly below that. “Our target is that we want to be at a maximum of 15% of the rent you are paying,” comments Chowdhary. “It’s a great time to build a rent-to-own company. It’s very hard for millenials to pay tens of thousands of dollars up front to get furniture for their apartment. Pabio makes this easy and affordable without compromising on quality,” said Tim Brady, partner at Y Combinator. The company is currently deploying its furniture rental services to around 100 homes. Previously, Pabio raised a $1 million pre-seed round. This time around, it adds an additional $2.2 million round, which includes Serpentine Ventures, Session.VC,  Tomahawk.VC, Pioneer Fund, and DD Venture Capital."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/target-global-leads-3-5m-pre-seed-in-nigerian-online-learning-platform-edukoya/","Target Global leads $3.5M pre-seed in Nigerian online learning platform Edukoya","","For years, offline test preparation centers in Nigeria have provided after-school guidance and tutoring to students who seek to pass entrance examinations. Edtech platforms such as Edukoya have sprung up with the intent to take these models online and maintain affordability for students. Today, the Lagos- and London-based startup, which builds online education content and offers online tutoring for students and their parents, raised $3.5 million in pre-seed funding led by European VC firm Target Global. The platform offers a range of features such as a 24/7 exam preparation and homework help, a question bank with step-by-step workings and personalized performance tracking systems. Edukoya was founded by CEO Honey Ogundeyi in May. She told TechCrunch that the platform, launched this month in beta, plans to go live fully in 2022. Nigeria’s education system is a stark representation of what exists in most countries in Africa: poorly equipped classrooms, few high-quality teachers, terrible infrastructure, irrelevant curriculum and ridiculous student-to-teacher ratios (it’s been as high as 46:1 in Nigeria for the primary level). As a result of these challenges, the average parent seeks after-school classes for their kids. Ogundeyi experienced this during her schooling days in Nigeria, and she said she started Edukoya after contrasting K-12 experiences in the West African country and the U.K. “Sometimes, even the most brilliant students can be let down by the system,” she said. “If my parents hadn’t made the sacrifice for me to go abroad, all the successes that I’ve had in my career would have been completely different. Now, I have two kids and seeing that same problem of going to school and struggling with some subjects made me look into getting after-school teachers. And it just struck me that this thing hasn’t changed pretty much for the last 50 years. If we look at all the innovation across different industries, Africa’s education system has remained untouched for 50 years; it’s been stagnant.”  Image Credits: Edukoya At the end of every K-12 education, the goal of most students is to get into a university. Like in the U.S., where the SAT is the standardized test for college admissions, the Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB) and West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) are the equivalents for university admissions in Nigeria. Students typically practice for these exams with materials containing previous test questions. Edukoya bundled these practice tests for both entrance exams (about 20,000) into its mobile application. Edukoya said it provides step-by-step solutions to “solve tough problems on past examination papers,” and students can connect to experienced tutors to help them out whenever they are stuck. The platform then provides insights with scores, time spent per question and other stats to help students identify their strengths and areas for improvement. In the few months that the platform has been in beta with a handful of users, Edukoya claims that 96% of students using its platform received higher marks during recent tests than when they didn’t use Edukoya. Edukoya isn’t the first edtech startup to have launched an online learning or test preparation application in Nigeria. So many similar platforms cropped up in the last five years that it seemed it was the only brand of edtech that could be built in the country. A lot of them have closed or achieved little or no scale. Edukoya has yet to do either. But after raising the largest pre-seed round in Nigeria and on the continent, the startup is poised to achieve a grander scale than its predecessors, which only secured paltry sums of VC money. Furthermore, Ogundeyi believes Edukoya’s approach to learning makes it stand out from its competition and previous platforms. “This model is unique in that we are reaching parents and learners 100% online and supporting them not only across exams but also the day-to-day learning, homework, support, etc. “Edukoya goes beyond exam prep. First, it’s an educational partner to parents and learners in primary and secondary school. We’ve seen people tackle smaller pockets in different ways, but not in a holistic way that we’re thinking about it,” she said.  Image Credits: Edukoya Most edtechs that play in this space tend to launch their platforms for grades 1-12. Edukoya is looking at it differently. Its platform is only available to students in grades 10-12, the segment taking exams into tertiary institutions. Ogundeyi said that once the company tests with this very tight segment and five core subjects, it will open up to cover more subjects and other grade levels. Explaining why the company adopted this strategy, the CEO said, “I think that’s from my core focus — one of the things I got from Google, which is to make a core group of people love you first. We are working with the last three grades, which are very important in Nigeria because that’s where people take those exams. And we think this is a good sort of test bucket to work with a really core group of people who need an intervention in that space. Once we have proven that it works here, it’s easier for us to expand it across other curriculum years and grades.” Edukoya is free now, but Ogundeyi said the company would explore a freemium model where premium products are used to upsell students or parents. Ogundeyi noted that Edukoya would need to keep sourcing experienced teachers to provide tutoring services for this to happen. For new-age edtechs, including YC-backed Kenyan startup Kidato, Tencent and Owl Ventures portfolio company uLesson, targeting these three communities (students, teachers and parents) is paramount from day one. This isn’t the CEO’s first spell at running a startup. In 2014, she founded Fashpa, a Nigerian fashion e-commerce store. Her professional career spans consulting and managerial roles at McKinsey & Company, Ericsson, Google and UK-Nigeria Tech Hub. She was also the founding CMO of Kuda, the Nigerian neobank founded by Babs Ogundeyi. He is one of the angel investors in this round; others include his co-founder Musty Mustapha, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, Stash founders Brandon Krieg and Ed Robinson, and Aux Money CEO Raffael Johnen. Lina Chong, the investment director at Target Global, confirmed her firm’s investment, saying, “Edukoya’s mission to provide better quality to millions of African students, combined with the team’s ability to execute on this ambition, left an immediate impression on myself and the whole team at Target Global. Their business has the potential to unlock learner potential and improve lives across generations.” Ogundeyi mentioned that a bulk of the pre-seed funding would expand its team and learner base and build out the technology for its learning platform, including support for its pan-African and European developer hubs. The CEO was one of the earliest female founders in Nigeria. Seven years after her first startup, she has now raised the largest round at this stage in this “minority group.” Though she’s impressed by the quality of female founders springing forth and the check sizes they are commanding, she said it’s still early days for her clique. “I’ve been in this space for a long time and I’m particularly passionate about female founders and expanding the scope of what we can do. I don’t make that segmentation so much. Given the right opportunity and the right experience, female founders can build big valuable businesses. This is just day one for us as part of that journey.”"

The second fund, launched in the first quarter of this year, was expected to close at $50 million, but investor and limited partner (LP) interest saw the fund oversubscribed. The LPs involved are unnamed. They include U.S.-based asset managers, a university endowment, global family offices, tech founders, hedge fund portfolio managers and investors from private equity and venture capital, the firm said. The effort by the New York, Accra and Cairo-based firm, an early investor in African unicorns Flutterwave and Andela, follows large fund closes by the likes of Partech, Novastar, Algebra and TLcom Capital that have sporadically happened on the continent. With large funds, most of these firms tend to find their sweet spots in growth-stage deals, particularly in Series A and B. But recently, they are beginning to get involved in earlier rounds to gain stakes to help them compete for the late-stage investments. For instance, TLcom Capital, a $71 million pan-African fund that initially made investments only in the growth stage, led pre-seed rounds in Nigeria’s Okra and Autochek last year (it co-led the latter with 4DX Ventures). Pre-seed to Series B are the stages on which 4DX Ventures is focused, founding partners Walter Baddoo and Peter Orth told TechCrunch in an interview. “The quality of founders and team is really our North Star. And our goal is to partner with the very best teams going after transformative opportunities across the continent,” Orth said. “And you know, Walter and I personally have experienced investing in companies from the idea stage to public markets and, generally speaking, we think that from the pre-seed to Series B stage, it’s still early enough to deliver the type of returns that we’re looking for as an early-stage fund.” The founding partners have known each other for more than 20 years. Between them, they have years of operational and financial experience working at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Bridgewater Associates. They started 4DX Ventures officially in 2017 after three years of investing personal funds in African startups. Global talent marketplace Andela and payments company Flutterwave were part of the firm’s early success, generating significant secondary returns due to their unicorn status. 4DX Ventures’ first fund was a bit over $20 million and it invested in startups such as Ghanaian health tech startup mPharma and Kenyan B2B e-commerce platform Sokowatch. It has welcomed the likes of Autochek, Breadfast, MaxAB, Taager, Trella and Yoco from this second fund of $60 million. Pan-African VC firms predominantly write their checks to the Big Four markets: Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt and Kenya because that’s where most of the continent’s opportunities reside. 4DX Ventures is not entirely different, as most of its portfolio companies are based in these four countries. But Orth is quick to add that the firm has begun looking into other countries, especially in the Francophone region; case in point, the investment it co-led into Ivorian fintech CinetPay this month. As for industries, 4DX Ventures says it is a “generalist,” but most of its investments have taken place in fintech, B2B e-commerce, healthcare and logistics. “Our goal is ultimately to invest in companies that are building products that solve foundational problems on the continent and also in the largest markets because the size of the market matters quite a bit for the potential outcome of companies,” Baddoo said about the markets and industries that pique 4DX’s interests.  “And so we love when folks are building products in markets that are truly large, and potentially give the companies that opportunity to have a pretty dramatic growth path throughout their lifecycle.” Baddoo also highlighted that asides from the market and industries, 4DX Ventures also seeks “strong founders with a growth mindset who have a lot of grit” and can “marry a very clear vision of what they’re trying to build with a thoughtful approach to strategy and execution.” The pan-African firm writes checks of about “a few $100,000 to a few million” across all stages (pre-seed to Series B), according to Orth. Since launching its first fund, 4DX Ventures has invested in more than 40 companies across Africa (its primary market), the Middle East and the U.S., with a handful of companies. One of its portfolio companies, U.S.-based Swarm Technologies, got acquired by SpaceX. 4DX Ventures says its portfolio companies have raised more than $1.2 billion in funding, one of the largest follow-on investments known for an African-focused fund. The close of this second fund also brought additional experience to the firm’s management team in two general partners, Dan Marlo and Raaid Ahmad. Before their appointment, the pair served as senior advisors to the firm since 2017. Both bring years of experience operating, investing and advising companies in various sectors such as fintech, telco, software, sports, social and health, the firm said in a statement.  “Both Dan Marlo and Raaid have been senior advisors to 4DX since the beginning of the fund. And prior to them joining as senior advisors, we’ve known each other for a decade. They are both experienced operators who have a scarce combination of skill sets. And going into our next Fund and the future of the company, we couldn’t think of two better people to join to help us, you know, carry the firm into our next chapter here,” said Orth on the appointment. NBA Hall of Famer and Congolese-American former professional basketball player Dikembe Mutombo, known for his humanitarian and entrepreneurial work, especially for Africans and African Americans, will now serve in the firm’s senior advisory role. He joins a current senior advisor roster that includes Karen Karniol-Tambour of Bridgewater Associates, Jay Zaveri of Social Capital and Sakya Duvvuru of Nellore Capital.  Baddoo, who is Ghanaian by birth, is bullish on his firm’s work and hinted that his association with the continent is part of what drives the deals 4DX Ventures makes. “Growing up in Accra, Ghana, a lot of these companies are solving problems that I witnessed, personally firsthand. And so the fact that we can dedicate our time to back some of the greatest founders of this generation that are building truly special and important companies on a continent, to me, is a dream. And the ability to do that where I come from is quite important. So my hope and belief is that 4DX will continue to play a very pivotal role in the ecosystem.”"

General Catalyst led the one-year-old startup’s Series A funding. Eight Roads Ventures, Elevation Capital, Arbor Ventures as well as existing investors Lightspeed and Accel participated in the round. The new round, which follows last year’s $18.5 million seed funding, values Uni at about $350 million, according to two people familiar with the matter. TechCrunch reported earlier that Uni was in talks to raise a round at over $300 million valuation. Bangalore-based Uni is among a handful of startups in India that is attempting to bring the benefits of credit cards to the masses. Even as nearly a billion Indians have a bank account, only a sliver of this population is covered by the country’s young credit rating system. Fewer than 30 million Indians have a credit card today, which has created a huge whitespace for startups like Uni and Tiger Global-backed Slice to innovate on tech and reach more consumers. Uni offers its customers a pay-later card that automatically splits the bill in three parts spread across three months. If customers pay within the three months, they are not charged any interest fee. If they settle the bill in one month, they get a 1% cash-back reward. The startup, which uses its own underwriting tech to determine applicants’ credit worthiness, launched the card in June this year and says it is already disbursing $23 million to its customers each month. The startup did not disclose how many users it has amassed, but said its customers are spread across 50 Indian cities.  Image Credits: Uni Nitin Gupta, who co-founded PayU India and then ran ride-hailing firm Ola’s financial services business, co-founded Uni last year. Lightspeed and Accel backed the startup at a time when it had yet to launch a product. “The Indian credit market is ripe for explosion and there is vast room for innovation. We found a strong product-market fit with our very first product, the Pay 1/3rd card — a first of its kind card in the market — and haven’t looked back from there,” said Gupta. “BNPL [buy now, pay later] is growing at a breakneck speed in India and within BNPL we are seeing that the biggest potential lies in the Pay1/3rd category and we are leading this space with our innovative product and customer experience. We are delighted to have some of the best investors in the world partnering with us as we gear up for our next phase of growth.” In an interview with TechCrunch, Gupta said the startup is working on developing a number of new products and aims to expand its monthly disbursement to $197 million in the next nine months. “We are thrilled to be partnering with Nitin, Prateek, Laxmikant and the rest of the Uni team as they build category defining financial services products for Indian consumers,” said Alex Tran, managing director at General Catalyst, in a statement. “There are few countries in the world where the opportunity for credit expansion is as massive as in India, and we believe some iconic companies will be built to capture this opportunity in the next decade. We are excited to back a team that is world class on credit, risk and payments while also being hyper focused on product and customer delight.” Pay later fintech players today finance loans worth $500 million each year, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent note to clients. They expect the figure to balloon to $26 billion by 2025."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/educate-online-which-allows-remote-learning-at-international-schools-raises-4m-seed/","Educate Online, which allows remote learning at international schools, raises $4M Seed","","It was only earlier this week that we learned StudyFree — which connects students with international educational opportunities — had raised a $3 million seed round. But there’s more to this than being accepted on a traditional course. The pandemic has turned education into a remote industry, and tech startups have responded. Educate Online is a platform allowing international students to study at U.K., U.S. and Canadian schools, but there’s a twist. All the study is done online, remotely, full time or part time, without having to move to another country and bear the related costs. It’s now raised $4 million in seed funding from Xploration Capital, TMT Investments, Flyer One Ventures, Softline and Angelsdeck. In the past 12 months, the startup says it’s garnered 2,500 students from 18 countries, covering K-12 study, ESOL, career exploration, university preparation, and internship and mentorship programs. The platform also offers options for students to participate in on-campus summer or semester programs. It now plans to scale in LatAm, Asia and the Middle East. Competitors include agencies that are still focused on offline education such as Transitions Abroad, Smapse and Academic Families. Alexander Zheltov, co-founder and CEO of Educate Online, said: Educate Online was founded in 2018 and since then has placed more than 4,000+ children between the ages of 4-19 in top schools. After COVID-19 hit, we made a hard pivot to online education as we were seeing a surge of interest toward online education — in 2020 we grew 5.5x and we expect to continue growing 3-5x year over year. Eugene Timko, managing partner at Xploration Capital said: Schools have historically been very local operations. Few have branched out to other countries, primarily through building foreign campuses and local partnerships. This has significantly limited the potential reach for international school education. Educate Online may become the dominant online layer on top of the existing schools’ infrastructure, vastly expanding the current market for cross-border education."
2021-12-15,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/mimi-series-b/","Mimi turns up the volume on its hearing well-being platform","","TechCrunch Battlefield (NYC 2014) finalists Mimi Hearing Technologies just closed its $25 million Series B funding to continue whispering its mission of hearing well-being from the rooftops. The company recently announced a series of high-profile partnerships with Skullcandy, Cleer and Beyerdynamic, and is now plowing onwards with its fresh infusion of cash from MIG Capital and ATHOS. “There’s a lot of scope for software-based solutions that can deal with things beyond hearing difficulties,” Nick Clark, one of the founders of Mimi, who heads up the company’s R&D, told me a while back. “You can start doing subtle things that benefit a broader and broader audience depending on their differences in hearing.” Mimi has one of the most popular at-home hearing testing apps, where around 50,000 people per month test their hearing. The company has made the same technology available to headphone manufacturers as an SDK. The apps can then use these hearing profiles to create customized audio outputs specifically tailored to your hearing. That means that it’s possible to hear better without turning the volume up to make up for the areas of your hearing where you may have hearing loss. The theory is that this prevents further hearing loss. “You can buy Skullcandy headphones, download the application and you create your profile there,” explains Mimi’s CEO and founder Philipp Skribanowitz. “But this profile is also compatible with other partners, and you can use it everywhere. We also have developed tests on a TV for Philips, so you just sit on your couch and do the test on your TV.” The money is earmarked for further investment in the company’s technology, especially in terms of expanding its offerings across headphone and TV integrations. The company will also be ramping up the expansion of sales and marketing operations across the U.S. and Asia. “The leading investors of our Series B consortium — MIG, Athos and Salvia — garnered international attention last year as the founding investors in BioNTech, the Nasdaq-listed German biotech company that, together with Pfizer, developed the first COVID-19 vaccine and is now valued at approximately $70 billion,” noted Mimi CFO Moritz Bratzke. “Their investment in Mimi is another testament not only to the depth and breadth of the German venture capital climate, but also to the importance and tremendous commercial potential of Mimi’s vision.”"

Wowzi, which connects social media users with advertisers and provides consumer insights, has secured a total of $3.2 million from investors over the last few months, part of which includes a recently concluded $2 million seed round that was led by the Africa-focused venture capital firm 4DX Ventures. This was preceded by a $1.2 million pre-seed round. Other investors in the seed round were To.org, Golden Palm Investments, LoftyInc Capital, Afropreneur Angels and Future Africa. Andela co-founder Christina Sass and former Andela executives Jessica Chervin, Justin Ziegler, as well as Johnny Falla, who currently serves as chief development and growth officer at Wowzi, took part in the round too. Wowzi plans to use the new investment to set up operations in Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa, seeking growth opportunities beyond Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, where it currently has a physical presence. It plans to use these new hubs to enter more countries across the continent. “We are primarily focused on expanding across Africa in 2022 and in other emerging markets globally,” Wowzi co-founder and CEO, Brian Mogeni, told TechCrunch. “We are also adding new product capabilities and features, as we continue to develop our technology and provide additional value to our communities,” he said. Wowzi makes it possible for brands to partner with social media users for marketing campaigns. This a new form of digital marketing that pivots from the norm of using celebrities for marketing campaigns. Wowzi said by using normal internet users, it is tapping “more authentic engagements or product endorsements” from people who interact with these brands on a daily basis. The startup also relieves brands from the stress of managing influencers as the platform operates in an automated fashion. To post a campaign, brands filter out their preferred influencer demographic groups based on characteristics like gender, location, profession or income levels. Wowzi then matches them with the right type of influencers for their needs. The brands then refine their search (based on the content shared or level of activity) and then reach out to the influencers they desire. “Managing influencers is difficult; from establishing contact, negotiations, contracting, ensuring that content is delivered and is posted on time to following up on payment. It is a lot of work. We manage the entire process with the brand to make sure that it’s successful,” said Falla. Wowzi influencers are categorized as nano, micro, mega, meta and super (celebrities), and they carry out marketing campaigns for brands via their social media accounts on sites like TikTok, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. However, Wowzi’s focus is mainly on nano and micro influencers (social media users with less than 10,000 followers). Anyone with at least 250 (nano influencers) connections on a social site fits the profile of a Wowzi influencer, but interested candidates must go through several verification levels before they start getting gigs. “Brands want to have more authentic engagements or endorsements for products, from people who use and love them, and can talk about real practical applications. Our campaigns show that nano influencers deliver better sales leads because of the higher trust with their following,” Falla told TechCrunch. “Brands also access a community of their most likely customers, and so this makes the campaigns hyper targeted for them as well,” said Falla.  Wowzi co-founders (l-r) Mike Otieno, Hassan Bashir and Brian Mogeni. Image Credits: Wowzi Wowzi works with creative agencies or directly with brands to help them scale their campaigns. It has so far worked with Coca-Cola, Netflix, Safaricom, Diageo, P&G and Absa Bank. The processes are automated, which means that brands get data they can use to evaluate the reach of the marketing campaigns. “We offer a really comprehensive reporting dashboard online. So, brands can check in to see exactly what happened, what posts were made by the influencers, which ones performed the best and analytics of the demographics for people who were actually reached,” said Falla. Wowzi is the brainchild of Mogeni, Hassan Bashir and Mike Otieno, who co-founded the company mid-2019 but the platform went live a day before Kenya’s president imposed the first lockdown last year. As it later turned out, a window of opportunity opened as more brands realized that they had to adopt other ways of marketing as travel and human interaction remained limited. The startup has so far worked with 200 brands, carried out over 15,000 campaigns and delivered over 200,000 paid gigs to date. Wowzi has grown 20x over the last one year. More recently, brands are able to post market research jobs including the engagement of influencers in polls or surveys. This is part of Wowzi’s plan to grow beyond an influencer marketing platform to a jobs aggregator. “We recently rolled out a market intelligence service which enables the same brands, SMEs or development agencies to pull information in a faster, targeted and richer format from their focal segments,” said Mogeni. Wowzi is now eyeing over 1 million job opportunities in the short term as it establishes a strong pan-African presence. This goal is achievable for the startup, which has successfully conducted campaigns across multiple markets in Africa including Mauritius, Mozambique, Zambia and Cameroon. “We actually had our first engagement in Cameroon recently after Netflix asked us to work with them in an additional eight countries. And so, what we have seen is that we can scale easily, even without the need for a physical presence,” said Falla. Across sub-Saharan Africa, 303 million people, about 28% of the population, are connected to the mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA Mobile Economy report. This is expected to grow to about 40% of the population by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses like Wowzi."

I knew the organization primary through its consumer hardware companies — a primary focus when it was founded, back in 2014. Brinc has expanded its scope a fair bit in the intervening years, with big focuses on things like food, health and deep tech. Seems it’s set to continue expanding its reach, going forward with eyes on categories like web3 and NFTs. Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands appears to be playing a big role in the move. Last year, the pair launched the blockchain/NFT accelerator Launchpad Luna. Animoca is also leading a $30 million Series B round for Brinc that finds the accelerator looking to expand its offering of programming, adding locations and hiring additional headcount. In a call with TechCrunch, Brinc co-founder Bay McLaughlin pointed at a number of markets in Asia as targets for potential expansion, including Japan, Korea, Singapore and India, as well as added presence in China. In November, the company is also opening an office in Brazil — its first in Latin America. In all, Brinc currently sports seven offices, with people operating out of a total of 12 locations. In addition to the Series B participation, Animoca will also be investing $100 million directly into startups through Brinc, in a manner similar to a VC fund. “Brinc is the leading name in startup acceleration for emerging markets and technologies, and its sights are set firmly on the future and on sustainability,” Animoca chairman and founder Yat Siu said in a release tied to the news. “We share a common vision of an open future with blockchain adoption in traditional and growth sectors, and we look forward to the innovations that will emerge from its acceleration programs.”"

It’s easy to shrug off the development, but this new pool brings the assets Norwest has raised altogether across the decades to $12.5 billion. Put another way, despite that gigantic fund announcements have become routine, this one is kind of a big deal and another indicator that this market is a very different one from even five years ago. Certainly, one can see why, in a go-go environment, Wells might agree to such a commitment. For one thing, on the growth equity side, it’s not possible to compete anymore unless you have a ginormous money cannon. Consider that Tiger Global Management alone held a first close of $8.8 billion on its biggest fund ever back in October, according to Bloomberg. (As a reminder, it closed its previous fund with $6.7 billion just six months ago.) To win deals, you need to be able to elbow out at least some of the other multibillion-dollar funds that are also writing checks right now. Tiger Global just closed one of the biggest venture funds ever, with $6.7 billion  Norwest’s team also has a lot of hits about which to boast. While it was busy deploying its last fund, a $2 billion pool that it closed in 2019 and used to fund about 60 companies — almost 30 of Norwest’s earlier bets have “exited” in some fashion over the last couple of years. The security outfit Shape Security, for example, sold to the application delivery company F5 for $1 billion in late 2019 after raising $183 million in funding, per Crunchbase data. Aporeto, a machine identity-based micro-segmentation company, sold to Palo Alto Networks for $150 million in cash in 2019 after raising around $35 million from investors, according to Crunchbase. A third portfolio company, a Canadian developer of risk and compliance software called Galvanize, meanwhile sold to corporate governance software maker Diligent for a reported $1 billion. Galvanize had raised around $50 million in funding led by Norwest. A number of Norwest’s consumer-facing investments also hit the public market. Two of these went out via SPAC: the real estate company Opendoor, and the digital mental health company Talkspace. A third portfolio company, Udemy, began trading publicly in October after staging a traditional IPO. (Its shares are trading down by roughly one-third of their offering price as of this writing.) Udemy targets valuation of $4B in major edtech IPO  Norwest currently operates in the Bay Area but it also has offices in Tel Aviv, Israel, and in India, so it has extensive geographic reach. The outfit also invests in a wide range of companies. Some of these are life sciences outfits. Some are direct-to-consumer retail plays. Others are fintech startups like Plaid, whose Series C round Norwest joined in 2018, and the consumer finance startup Dave, which expects to close a merger with a blank-check company shortly and to begin trading publicly in January. Of this last sector, longtime partner Lisa Wu, who led the Plaid deal, notes that Norwest’s interest ties exclusively to the upside it sees in such companies. Norwest, she makes clear, is not a strategic investor. “Wells gives us a competitive advantage, but our relationship with Wells is really an arm’s length relationship,” she says. “We have complete investment authority and autonomy over our investment processes.” One area where Norwest notably hasn’t yet made a deal is in world of crypto. Asked about this, Wu suggests that it’s just a matter of time. “We talk about it every day,” she says. “We believe in the momentum . . . it’s coming [now] in Fund XVI.”"
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/sonic-identity-is-the-missing-component-for-social-metaverse-experiences/","Sonic identity is the missing component for social metaverse experiences","Expressing the real you|Providing cover|What’s missing in the metaverse","In the many conversations around “the metaverse” sparked by the Facebook corporate name transition to Meta, much has focused on the visual elements. What’s hardly mentioned is audio. Yet voice really matters when making a virtual environment come to life. Sometimes, it’s everything. Just ask Spike Jonze. The movie director discarded the original voice actor in the title role of his 2013 film “Her” and substituted Scarlett Johansson’s sultry timbres. Although Samantha, a computer operating system, never appeared in the flesh, Jonze felt the original actress hadn’t nailed the emotion required to create a three-dimensional persona. Voice was critical to creating a fleshed-out character that could absorb the viewer into the story’s premise and make it fully believable. As The Washington Post noted, many keystones of the Meta vision of the metaverse already exist in video gaming — only in disconnected gaming worlds. And in the gaming universe, voice is playing an increasingly important role. Meta promises a unified, interoperable experience, but without a rich panoply of highly textured, lifelike digital voices, the metaverse will be incomplete rather than inclusive and immersive. The McGurk Effect research of the mid-1970s observed the cognitive dissonance resulting from mismatched audio and visual perceptions; voices that don’t fully mesh with an avatar can rip the participant from the virtual environment. Humans are social beings, and the metaverse as currently promoted is a social environment where participants create unique personas in both home and workplace settings. Avatars will allow players to express themselves the way they want to be seen — as human, alien, animal, vegetable, cartoon or myriad other options. Players can try on new “looks” temporarily, the way they try new outfits. Gender and species are fluid. Changing identity is hamstrung, however, if people are not able to change how they sound along with their visual presence. Having your voice match the persona presented to other people is a core element of a personalized player identity. It is a situation many people are already accustomed to from video games. If you encounter a gritty, bearded, hulking knight in a game you are playing, you would expect that character to have a deep, gruff voice, accompanied by the clank of armor. Game companies make sure to deliver this, with non-player characters (NPCs) being carefully crafted by voice actors and audio specialists to provide an immersive experience. Yet in online gaming environments or in the future metaverse, where the knight is the representation of an actual person, you will have a vastly different experience. You may be startled to hear a high-pitched teenager with bad microphone quality instead of the anticipated gravelly, mature voice. The drastic incongruence between sound and vision shreds the immersive quality of the experience. Metaverse avatars can only be fully immersive if they allow people to create full digital experiences. In addition to enabling immersion, sonic identity technology can also allow players to slip into “true” pseudonymity. They can fully become the person (or being) they want others to see — which for many people is powerful protection from a sometimes hostile online environment. It can disguise a geographical accent so the participant can more smoothly integrate a player community (a capability an offshore customer support call center might benefit from). For people with vocal tics, it can cloak a physical impairment they’d rather not reveal. Voice changing technology can also help to mitigate online discrimination and harassment. A research study published in the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction in 2019 notes that female gamers frequently avoid verbal communication with other players to reduce unpleasant interactions. Voice changing technology can allow them to participate in fully pseudonymous conversations, free of a specified gender, in which they might feel more comfortable in expressing themselves. Regardless of the “why,” researchers in the scholarly journal Human-Computer Interaction concluded in 2014 that “voice radically transforms the experience of online gaming, making virtual spaces more intensely social.” From my own internal company data, it’s clear that players who communicate with voice alter egos feel more engrossed in the game, engage it for longer periods of time and spend more money within the game as a result. A truly complete immersive experience requires a combination of 3D visuals and real-time audio to enable people to express themselves in the way they want to be heard. Participants want a sonic representation of themselves that is just as original and unique as their visual avatar — and they want the tools to customize their voice as meticulously as their appearance. There must be a harmonious marriage of both augmented audio and 3D video to keep the player immersed and engaged. Real-time audio defines how people can bring the ultimate individuality to their content, making audio the great equalizer of the metaverse. Unfortunately, the current voice experience is challenged to offer the type of immersive qualities that will live up to the promise of an all-encompassing metaverse. Real-time audio personas are still restrictive at best, despite experimentation by dogged early adopters. The tools to shape a person’s voice to match their digital self are limited and sound quality does not yet match visual quality. Yet recent advancements in available audio technology are making it far easier for players to create a unique sonic identity. New solutions available to platform and game developers enable writers, producers and audio engineers to incorporate voice modification technology within their games to produce natural-sounding and fantasy voices on demand, in real time. It offers the potential to generate new avenues for monetization by delivering an inclusive and immersive auditory experience that lures players and keeps them fully focused and engaged in the experience rather than dropping away. Companies are investing in powerful tools that enable people to shape the visual representation of themselves in a digital space. They must not overlook the customized sonic identity for a matching social audio experience that makes the digital representation seamless. The metaverse won’t be complete without it."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/facebook-ethiopia-oversight-board/","Oversight Board calls on Meta to evaluate its role in spreading violence in Ethiopia","","The Oversight Board, a group Facebook created to review its policy decisions, weighed in on a case of misinformation in war-torn Ethiopia Tuesday, warning the company about the risks of allowing hate speech and unverified information to spread freely in conflict zones. The Oversight Board reviewed a post in Amharic from an Ethiopia-based Facebook user that claimed the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was responsible for murder, rape and looting in Raya Kobo and other population centers in the country’s Amhara region, aided by Tigrayan civilians. “While the user claims his sources are previous unnamed reports and people on-the-ground, he does not even provide circumstantial evidence to support his allegations,” the Oversight Board wrote in its evaluation. “Rumors alleging that an ethnic group is complicit in mass atrocities, as found in this post, are dangerous and significantly increase the risk of imminent violence.” The post was initially detected by Facebook’s automated content moderation tools and removed when the platform’s Amharic language content review team determined it violated the platform’s rules against hate speech. Facebook reversed its own decision and reinstated the content after the case was escalated to the Oversight Board. The Oversight Board overturned Facebook’s decision to reinstate the post, citing a violation of Facebook’s rules against violence and incitement rather than the hate speech rules the platform had cited previously. In its decision, the group expressed concern that the spread of unverifiable rumors in violence-stricken areas like Ethiopia could “lead to grave atrocities, as was the case in Myanmar.” The month, a group of Rohingya refugees in the U.S. filed a $150 billion class-action suit against Meta, alleging that Facebook’s entrance into the country served as a “key inflection point” in the genocide of the Rohingya people. Misinformation stoking ethnic violence in Myanmar spread broadly on Facebook, often sown by military personnel, and is widely believed to have escalated ethnic violence that targeted and displaced the country’s Muslim minority. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen has cited algorithmically amplified ethnic violence in countries like Myanmar and Ethiopia — and Meta’s failure to adequately address it — as one of the platform’s biggest dangers. “What we saw in Myanmar and are now seeing in Ethiopia are only the opening chapters of a story so terrifying, no one wants to read the end of it,” Haugen told Congress in October. The Oversight Board also instructed Meta to order an independent human rights assessment on Facebook and Instagram’s role in exacerbating the risk of ethnic violence in Ethiopia and to evaluate how well it can moderate content in the country’s languages. Last month, Meta defended the safety precautions it had taken in the country, highlighting expanded applications of some of its rules against misinformation and hate speech. The company also noted that it had improved its enforcement abilities there in the past two years and now has the capability to review content in Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Tigrinya, the four most common languages.

2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/2022-porsche-taycan-gts-cross-turismo-delivers-power-and-performance-in-a-wagon/","2022 Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo delivers power and performance in a wagon","The user experience isn't too shabby either|On the road with the Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo|At the track with the Porsche Taycan GTS|Charging the Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo|User experience","All good things come to those who wait, and Porsche has reserved the most powerful version of its all-electric Taycan for last: the 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and the wagon-style Taycan GTS Sport Turismo. For those who want power, refined and sporty driving, and the ability to forgo gasoline for an all-electric powertrain, the Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo both offer a solid blend of high-tech and powerful performance, which TechCrunch had a chance to test recently. GTS now comes in every model line Porsche offers, and the 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and GTS Sport Turismo round out a total of 10 different Porsche Taycan offerings. The upshot: The Sport Turismo GTS and its sedan sibling should be the benchmark for any luxury automaker trying to attract customers who want to make the transition from internal combustion to all-electric as smooth, seamless and reliable as possible. The drawback of course is that being a luxury vehicle puts the Taycan — and its many variants — out of reach for most people. Before Porsche purists sharpen their knives about how the Taycan and its variants aren’t “true Porsches,” they might consider how the EV has resonated with consumers. The electric vehicle, first announced in 2019, has been a tremendous sales success for the company. Porsche sold 28,640 Taycan vehicles in the January-to-September period of 2021, outselling its flagship 911 sports car as well as the Panamera, 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman vehicles. (Porsche’s two most popular vehicles, the Cayenne and Macan, still outpaced the Taycan in sales.) While the Taycan doesn’t come close to the number of Tesla Model 3 and Y sales reported this year, it has, so far, outstripped Tesla’s Model S and X sales. Tesla reports show that the company has delivered 13,214 Model S and Xs through the end of the third quarter. The sales numbers suggest that Porsche’s $1 billion investment in the development of the Taycan have paid off. My time in these two latest and last variants verify that those development dollars were well spent. The 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo are a sports sedan and wagon to be reckoned with. Porsche unveiled the new Taycan GTS and Sport Turismo GTS at an event prior to the LA Auto show a few weeks ago, and we got seat time in both vehicles just after the unveiling in and around the Los Angeles area. The Taycan GTS and GTS Sport Turismo sit below the line-topping 670-horsepower Turbo variant. Porsche says that Taycan GTS can accelerate from 0-60 miles per hour in just 3.5 seconds thanks to its 590-horsepower and 626 pound-ft of torque coming from a pair of permanent magnet synchronous motors at the front and rear of the car. That means that both variants of the GTS are all-wheel drive, though during normal driving, the balance of power is pushed down through the rear wheels. That rear motor comes from the Porsche Taycan Turbo, and Porsche says that this makes the GTS more agile and responsive on the road. The motors are powered by a 93.4 kWh battery pack on 800-volt architecture, in both vehicles. That allows the vehicle to fast charge from 5% battery power up to 80% in just 22 minutes, which we got to try out at a DC fast charger in a local Walmart parking lot. I drove a bright red Taycan GTS Sport Turismo from downtown Los Angeles to Willow Springs (a one-way trip of around 90 miles) and back across the winding Angeles Crest Highway and Lake Hughes Road and back to downtown. The heavier wagon-style GTS Sport Turismo never belied that it had that big ol’ backside hanging out. Agile, responsive, and comfortable in the variety of modes that ranged from the electron-sipping Range setting to Normal, Sport, Sport + and Individual, the GTS Sport Turismo is a luxurious and mighty powerful electric wagon.  Image Credits: Porsche Whether making a pass on a two-lane highway near Willow Springs or winding it over the sun-beaten concrete on the Crest, the GTS Sport Turismo lives up to its Porsche-touted moniker as the “sweet spot,” between the lower 4S and the top-of-the-line Turbo — and it’s specifically geared for those who want a sports car feel in an all-electric people hauler. Porsche recalibrated the Porsche Active Suspension Management System, retuned the chassis, added an optional rear-steering system and adaptive anti-roll bars in the car we drove. In addition to this, the Taycan GTS and its wagon-y cousin get a new, optional, trick sunroof that goes from opaque to various stages of staggered panels, to clear, with the touch of a button. The roof is actually made of two panes of glass with liquid crystal nestled between, which creates a UV-blocking grey panel when fully activated or closed.  Image Credits: Abigail Bassett More than likely, most Taycan GTS buyers won’t ever track their sedan, but, for that very small handful of people who do, there’s plenty to be impressed with. The Taycan GTS sedan still offers ample room for four passengers and all the bells and whistles of the Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, without the hatchback styling. Instead of hauling a wagon around the track at Big Willow, which honestly, sounds like a blast, I climbed into a Taycan GTS sedan for a 30-minute lead-follow stint. The Taycan GTS comes with Porsche’s Track Precision app, which integrates with the new PCM 6.0 system in the car. Connect the app on your phone to the car and you can get detailed, real-time data on speeds, braking force, accelerator and brake input, and other information about just how you’re driving on the track. Mount your phone on your windshield and you’ll get the added bonus of a first-person POV video of the track that the app maps to everything from throttle input to steering angle and brake pressure. Willow Springs is a notoriously gnarly track both because of its age and its sans-landmark, off-camber turns. On the track, the Taycan GTS remained firmly planted as I rocketed up to 120 mph on the front straight. Larger front brakes on the Taycan GTS (the same on the Sport Turismo) helped quickly haul the electric sedan down to more manageable speeds for the series of turns that run up the hill to a blind but sweeping left-hand turn and the vehicle felt connected and precise. To say that the Taycan GTS is quick is an understatement. I drove Big Willow for the first time in a Lamborghini Huracán STO back in September. I don’t proclaim to be a race car driver, but, for context, my Porsche app-recorded lap time in the Taycan GTS sedan was only four seconds off of my best time in the STO — and that vehicle is specifically made for the race track. Suffice it to say, the Taycan GTS hauls on a closed course.  Image Credits: Abigail Bassett Once our track time was over, I climbed back into the GTS Sport Turismo for the slog back to downtown Los Angeles. When I set out from the hotel that foggy Saturday morning, I started out with a fully charged battery and a range of 235 miles. By the time we got to Willow Springs, after some spirited highway and canyon driving, the vehicle had around 130 miles of range left. The route was around 90 miles in total (one way) and I spent most of the drive toggling the wheel on the Race-Tex wrapped steering wheel, between Range, Sport + and Individual settings. These settings adjust the suspension, power and steering feel, and even the synthetic “engine sound” you hear on the Taycan GTS. The Individual setting, where I could separately set the steering feel and the ride to my liking, was my favorite. Los Angeles traffic is perpetual, which can pose a challenge for some electric vehicles and their range. I stopped at a Porsche-appointed stopover to charge the Taycan GTS at one of the public Electrify America chargers in Burbank with around 70 miles of range left. On a Saturday night, the place was absolutely packed with shoppers and EV chargers alike. There was only one DC fast charger, and according to the Porsche rep manning the charger to help journalists plug in, it had been out of service almost all day. When I arrived a Ford Mustang Mach-E was charging at the spot, so I pulled into one of the others that were vacant. To no EV owner’s surprise, the charger wouldn’t initiate for my GTS Sport Turismo. I tried three other chargers in the row, before finally returning to the DC fast charger, which, miraculously, connected and quickly charged my Taycan GTS Sport Turismo from 25% to 80% in just 20 minutes. While this was a problem specific to the Electrify America charger, not Porsche, it is indirectly a problem for any automaker counting on this network of DC fast chargers to help it compete with Tesla and its proprietary Supercharger network. The Electrify America chargers at that location continually failed to recognize the vehicle I was driving. When other journalists showed up to charge, they too, had a similar issue and we all got to play charger leapfrog with a handful of electric motorcycles and cars to find a charger that would work. While the charging infrastructure still needs a lot of work, the good news is that Porsche has made locating those chargers in its navigation system far easier than other electric automakers (with the exception of Tesla). There are three different ways to find available chargers in the system. You can use the capable voice recognition to ask for local chargers, which will then pop up on the navigation system for you choose. You can also use the touchscreen to set search parameters (including the brand of EV charger and speed of charge) to search for chargers nearby. Finally, you can use the Porsche app or the navigation in the infotainment system to set a route and the system will automatically find chargers along the route based on how much charge you want to have left when you arrive at your destination. The vehicles I drove were European-spec so I wasn’t able to try this setup myself, but one of the sedans at the track had some limited U.S-features available and a Porsche spokesperson walked me through the process. In addition to being able to access these features via the center screen, Porsche’s new infotainment screen stretches across to the passenger side of the car and allows passengers to search for chargers, change stereo inputs and stations, and navigate (amongst other things) while the vehicle is under way. Most automakers lock out access to these features in their vehicles both from the driver and passenger seats when they’re moving, a “feature,” that’s absolutely infuriating when actively trying to navigate or find locations while moving. It’s not so in the Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, since both the driver and passenger can still interact with numerous features on the infotainment system while the vehicle is rolling. The 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo will be delivered to customers willing to shell out for the $110,000+ price tag by Q2 of 2022. Pricing starts at $131,400 (plus $1,350 for delivery) for the sedan and $133,300 for the Sport Turismo. And in true Porsche style, nearly everything can be customized to your liking. Both offer plenty of performance and style for the proverbial buck in sleek, sleeper packaging that offers a solid balance of technology and refinement for the enthusiast and their passengers. The 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS, in any form, is truly an electric vehicle to be reckoned with."

2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/six-more-women-sue-tesla-over-workplace-sexual-harassment/","Six more women sue Tesla over workplace sexual harassment","","In the wake of Jessica Barraza’s lawsuit last month, six more current and former female employees have come forward to accuse Tesla of fostering a culture of rampant sexual harassment at its Fremont factory in California. In separate complaints filed on Tuesday with the Superior Court in Alameda County, the women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, physical contact and discrimination while at work. Jessica Brooks, one of the women who sued Tesla, alleges she was harassed on her first day of orientation at the automaker. She claims a supervisor told his male subordinates to “check out the new girl.” Brooks says the harassment was so constant she eventually stacked boxes around her workstation to deter her coworkers from whistling at her. Brooks also claims she complained of the situation to Tesla’s HR department. The company allegedly responded by moving Brooks to a different part of the factory instead of addressing the situation directly. “I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,” Brooks told The Washington Post. “That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.” When Jessica Barraza sued Tesla last month, she said she was subjected to “nightmarish” working conditions at the company’s Fremont plant. Barraza’s lawsuit described a factory floor that looked more like “a crude, archaic construction site or frat house” than the site of one of the most advanced EV makers in the country. Most of the seven women who have sued Tesla have linked the abuse they experienced to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. “He would make 69 or 420 jokes … which caused the technicians to be even worse,” said one of the complaints. The suit comes on the same day five former SpaceX employees accused Musk’s other company of doing little to stop sexual harassment. We’ve reached out to Tesla for comment. The automaker does not operate a public relations department. When a federal court recently ordered Tesla to pay $137 million to a Black worker who said they were subjected to daily racist abuse at the company’s Fremont factory, the company said: “We continue to grow and improve in how we address employee concerns. Occasionally, we’ll get it wrong, and when that happens we should be held accountable.” This story originally appeared on Engadget. "
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/using-data-driven-techniques-to-beat-the-great-resignation/","Using data-driven techniques to beat the Great Resignation","Human-centered technology","Much has been written about the long-term impact COVID-19 will have on how people do their jobs. Throughout the pandemic, people had the space and time to consider what really matters to them, and to ask the big questions such as “Am I happy?” For many people, the crisis has acted as a catalyst for change, leading to the Great Resignation, or the Great Talent Swap for those that lost employees to a competitor or different company. Life goals people perhaps once only daydreamed about are now becoming a reality with the plethora of options and flexibility now available. Our research at Workhuman bears this out: 30% of people looking for a new job say they are doing so for greater flexibility, and it seems that parents are particularly motivated to change, accounting for 65% of the total of job seekers. Clearly, many workers are looking for ways to better manage family and work responsibilities. For instance, research we conducted for our Human Workplace Index revealed that 56% of respondents who want to stay at their company say it’s because they like their company and/or co-workers. Culture is therefore key to winning and retaining workers. All of this is to say that businesses and leaders need to act. The Great Resignation has created an employee market where people have a wealth of openings available to them and they can be more selective about who they work for. Employers therefore need to give current employees a reason to stay and prospective employees a reason to apply. Building a strong employer brand is now mission critical. Companies that fail to do so risk stifling their own growth for a want of talent, as this voluntary turnover could cost businesses around the world billions of dollars. 	 Here are three areas where businesses can leverage data-driven techniques to drive employee satisfaction: Traditionally, HR technology has been transactional and focused on the task. The technology needed right now focuses on the people just as much as it does on their experience of the task being done. Human-centered technology that powers actions such as continuous feedback, employee recognition, celebrating individual and team accomplishments, and building a more human workplace have measurable bottom-line benefits because they strengthen employees’ emotional ties to each other and the organization. One approach could be to set up a peer-to-peer recognition platform where people can publicly recognize the work of their colleagues. The platform could potentially link to a rewards program whereby employees gain points toward goods or experiences. From an analytics perspective, the approach also provides valuable data on where good work is being done in the organization and by whom, enabling employers to identify high performers and ensure that they are adequately engaged at work.

2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/twitter-adds-auto-captions-feature-to-make-videos-more-accessible/","Twitter adds auto captions feature to make videos more accessible","","Starting today, Twitter is rolling out auto-generated captions on videos. This feature will make videos more accessible for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. Auto captions will be available on web, iOS and Android in over 30 languages, including English, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Thai, Chinese, Hindi and many more. The captions could become useful in Twitter’s new vertical feed the company began testing last week. The feed, if rolled out publicly, would make the app’s Explore tab resemble TikTok, serving one piece of algorithmically recommended content at a time, including videos. On feeds like this, captioned videos have become expected because they make it easier to scroll through feeds when you’re in a public place and headphones aren’t in reach. But unlike the video caption features on TikTok and Instagram Reels — which allow users to edit the captions’ text before posting — Twitter won’t let users tweak its captions. That means users won’t be able to correct any errors to make the automated captions more accurate. Twitter is the latest platform to test a TikTok copycat feature  Accessibility features like auto captions and image alt text have been getting more attention from Twitter after it finally created dedicated accessibility teams in September 2020. This staffing change was spurred after users criticized Twitter last summer for piloting a voice tweet feature without auto captions. Now, voice tweets and Spaces, Twitter’s Clubhouse competitor, both have captioning. While Twitter’s support for captions on videos is new, the company was already using captioning technology in its live audio chatrooms, called Twitter Spaces. The company notes it retains an audio copy of a Space, including the captions, for thirty days to review the content for violations of Twitter’s guidelines. If a Space is found to contain a violation, Twitter will hold on to these records for an additional 90 days to offer the speakers a chance to appeal their violation. Unfortunately for Twitter and users alike, this process doesn’t go far enough to address issues of abuse on its platform. Twitter Spaces users have been served blatantly harmful content — including Spaces with racist titles that remained on their feeds even after being reported. Twitter community manager Simon Balmain recently tweeted the company is working on the problem, but Twitter hasn’t yet detailed if or how its system will expand beyond its existing reporting features and the retention of Spaces’ audio and captions."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/proterra-to-build-commercial-ev-battery-factory-in-south-carolina-its-third-in-us/","Proterra to build commercial EV battery factory in South Carolina, its third in US","","Proterra, an American commercial electric vehicle company that produces transit buses and electric charging systems, is opening up its third battery factory in Greer, South Carolina. The factory should begin production in the second half of 2022 with “multiple gigawatt hours of annual battery system production capacity,” according to the company. Proterra did not disclose the specific production capacity expected at its South Carolina plant, but its two other plants in Burlingame, California and Los Angeles have a max annual capacity of 345 megawatt hours and 675 megawatt hours, respectively, according to Shane Levy, director of corporate communications. Globally, the electric commercial vehicle market is estimated to reach $62.4 billion this year. With myriad government and corporate initiatives focused on decreasing emissions, the commercial EV sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 17.3% over the next nine years, and automakers are racing to supply that demand. In January this year, General Motors announced its new commercial electric vehicle brand, Brightdrop, and in September, Ford beefed up its commercial EV unit ahead of the Ford E-Transit work van launch, to name a couple. With this new plant, Proterra has committed to creating more than 200 jobs in South Carolina and investing a minimum of $76 million into the 327,000-square-foot plant, which is located at the 42.76-acre Carolina Commerce Center. The factory, which is located near the company’s electric bus manufacturing facility, is Proterra’s entry into producing batteries in the eastern U.S., which the company says will bring it closer to its “Proterra Powered” customers. In addition to building its own electric vehicles, Proterra partners with other automakers to integrate its powertrains into their vehicles. Daimler’s Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley school bus from Thomas Built Buses, for example, is powered by Proterra, as are Volta’s new refrigerated trucks. The Greer battery production site comes a year after Proterra opened its second battery factory within its existing EV bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles. It will also be neighbors to commercial EV competitor Arrival, which recently shared plans to open its own battery module assembly plant in North Carolina. As more automakers begin producing EVs and wanting to control their own supply chain, more domestic battery assembly plants are sure to follow. Automakers have battery anxiety, so they’re taking control of the supply "
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/europes-final-push-on-the-digital-markets-act-must-include-default-settings/","Europe’s final push on the Digital Markets Act must include default settings","Why do default settings matter?|The free choice screen is a great step, but more needs to be done|Crucial time for EU legislators to support default settings in DMA","Europe has a deeply uneven tech playing field. But as members of the European Parliament prepare to vote in plenary on the Digital Markets Act (DMA) on Wednesday, there’s a chance to correct this course. MEPs must sustain significant progress made within the legislation, such as with regard to ad platforms, as well as the major wins brought home by the European Commission over recent months such as the Google Shopping case and Android choice screen — demonstrating the EU’s ability to take concrete action to create a fair and competitive European market. MEPs must now secure a majority on key amendments tabled ahead of the plenary and following the pivotal Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee vote last month. Of most importance are those focused on default settings that would finally prohibit tech giants such as Google from locking up search defaults on gatekeeping platforms and provide European consumers with real choice across mobile and desktop devices once and for all. The vast majority of internet users have never chosen their search engine and 95% of people stick with their default platform. Data shows the power of default settings and, given the sums that Google currently pays to secure its preset default position on other gatekeeping platforms, it is no wonder that the tech giant is able to maintain 97% of search engine market share on mobile across Europe. Last summer, following sustained pressure from independent search engines such as Ecosia, the European Commission instructed Google to drop the pay-to-play element of its Android choice screen — a widely discredited self-devised remedy created by Google following the 2018 Android decision, where it was fined €4.3 billion for monopolistic behavior. From our preliminary data, we saw our search volumes on Android mobile devices increase by approximately 7% in just two months after Google opened up the choice screen to alternative providers — which, on current projections, amounts to 50% over the coming year. We know that when given an opportunity to select their default search engine, more and more Europeans would choose to select alternatives to Google that align more with their environmental or privacy values. However Google’s choice screen still falls short in a number of ways, as noted in this joint letter signed by Ecosia, DuckDuckGo, Qwant and Lilo and in alignment with BEUC. For this reason, we collectively called on legislators to ensure every user is freely able to choose which search engine they use on desktop and mobile operating ecosystems through a “one-click switch” mechanism, as well as banning sweetheart deals between gatekeepers that currently provide default status on a number of web browsers. The joint letter also highlights the failures of the remedy to only apply to a fraction (just 2%) of the total mobile market. By failing to extend a choice screen beyond new devices, millions of existing Android users are not able to select alternative search engines and Google continues to profit from a proven infringement across the existing mobile devices, not to mention desktops (or other devices). We’ve advocated for default settings for years and proved our case. What has been deemed anti-competitive by the EU in the case of the Android choice screen must now be reflected in EU law via the DMA. Unfortunately, the current version of the DMA will not prevent Google from hoarding default positions everywhere it can and addressing its entrenched dominant position. As the DMA approaches its final crucial stages, we urge EU legislators to resist bending to pressure from gatekeepers at the expense of millions of consumers and push default settings to the top of the priority list. With calls for mandating choice screens reverberating across regulatory bodies around the world in a bid to break Google’s dominance of the search market, the DMA must mandate that all gatekeeper platforms provide users with a fair choice screen at no cost for default settings and allow users to switch their default settings with a clear, accessible one-click switch. Failing to address default settings in the DMA not only cements the status quo but eradicates the prospect of installing fair competition and real consumer choice for Europeans for years to come, which could undermine the EU’s leading position as it prepares to write the rules for the next chapter of the internet."

Webcams, welcome to 2021.” The message was accompanied by an open box, with a few identifying details — including the company’s name — pixelated out. That information, ultimately, wasn’t too difficult to come by, with the company and product’s name — Opal C1 — printed in white on the border just above the lens. Reaction was swift. The “shut up and take my money Gifs flowed.” It was, after all, a handsome device, backed by at least one known quantity. And more pressingly, it arrived at the height of a technological pain point that’s been virtually universally acknowledged. Webcams, in a word, suck.  Image Credits: Brian Heater That’s not any kind of revelation. It’s not like they just started sucking. It’s just that, until recently, it’s just been a thing that we’ve been able to live with. But by the fiftieth time you’ve peered into some CNN correspondent’s apartment at 480p through a coat of Crisco, you begin questioning the nature of the world. Of course, you don’t have to appear on cable news every night to want an upgrade. Maybe you bought a Logitech — or perhaps your work splurged to jury rig a DSLR. Both cases expose what’s ultimately a huge, under-addressed market. And while at the beginning of the pandemic it may have seemed like a momentary blip, even if/when this whole thing ends, it’s clear that there won’t really be a normal to go back to. As much as corporate offices have dragged their heels, we appear to have turned a corner on the question of remote work. It’s quickly become more rule than exception, leaving many asking the same question: Where’s the iPhone of webcams? It seems simple enough. Take all the learnings from smartphone imaging and apply them to a stagnant market.  L-R: 2020 iMac Webcam, Opal C1. Image Credits: Brian Heater It doesn’t appear to be coming from Apple. Not in the near-term, at least. To the company’s credit, they’ve made some strides, first through digital image processing on its M1 chips and then by actually upgrading the built-in sensors. But for many, better’s not good enough. That was more or less the thinking that sent Opal’s founders down their path. By the time Ohanian’s tweet arrived, Opal had been working on the C1 for seven months. That’s basically overnight in hardware startupland, but at the very least, they had a good-looking piece of hardware couched in nice packaging, with an air of VC mystery sprinkled in. The company says it’s now managing a 16,000-person waitlist. “[The response] was overwhelming,” says co-founder and president Stefan Sohlstrom. “It was really gratifying for us to see. We’re the most two bullish people on what we’re building. We obviously felt like not only is the market big, that’s obvious, but the need was very deep. It wasn’t just that, sure, millions of people would buy this. It was for the people that are doing this for their job, this is an important thing for them. This is how they communicate with the world.”  Image Credits: Brian Heater Opal’s journey officially began in November of 2020, with a simple question. “If we were to build a webcam today, what are the technologies that are available to us that make an iPhone as close to a DSLR as possible?” says co-founder and CEO Veeraj Chugh. “We did a lot of research talking to folks in the industry, talking to users and talking to people who worked at competitors previously. The overwhelming response, ‘this should exist and the technology needs to look very, very different than every webcam that came before.’” By December, the team raised an undisclosed seed round, and a month later, it began building a team of designers and engineers who had previously worked for companies like Apple, Google and Magic Leap. The result is a lovinglycrafted $300 piece of hardware with a 7.8mm, 4K Sony sensor and a built-in beamforming mic mesh array. It’s unquestionably the best-looking webcam I’ve tested. I recognize that — in and of itself — isn’t saying much, but I do spend a lot of hours every day staring into one, so it might as well be nice to look at.  Image Credits: Brian Heater It also may end up being the most capable. But here is where I hedge my bets and tell you that my hands-on time with the product has effectively entered me into beta testing. Opal is aiming for an out-of-the-box, plug and play experience — and for a company that only recently celebrated its first anniversary, it’s well on its way. As we push closer to a kind of general availability, I’ll feel more comfortable reviewing the product. For now, I’m content to give the C1 a longer leash than I do review products. It’s an exciting new device from an exciting new company. It has problems and unfulfilled promises — more or less what you’d expect from a limited beta from a brand new company. The device sitting above the screen of my M1 iMac is final hardware. The software, on the other hand, is still very much in beta. What I received is beginning to roll out to select customers, starting today. Per Opal: Units start shipping to the public on December 14th. Customers on the waitlist can purchase the camera with an invite. We’re slowly rolling out to ensure the customer experience exceeds expectations – once we cross a positive threshold there, we will roll out in quantities in the tens of thousands.  Image Credits: Brian Heater 4K isn’t up and running yet. “We’ve temporarily disabled 4K video, as it is not compatible with most video conferencing apps, and it was giving users a hard time,” the company notes. “We are relaunching shortly with a stronger warning, and will be available for applications that do support, for recording videos and the like.” Opening the beta control software on my desktop, the Audio tab is grayed out. Using the mic array up front and ambient mics on the rear, the company has some big things planned down the road: We’re focusing on building the markets leading Noise Cancellation, and using the same learnings to build something we call Studio Sound. Studio sound allows you to sound like you’re on a professional podcast, without the $500 boom mic. Using MicMesh inputs piped through a neural net, we’ll be able to make your sound professional quality. The sound, as it stands, is good. And by “good,” I mean work-meeting good, not going on CNN or recording my podcast good. If you do either of those things, you’re going to want to stick to that devoted mic. In the future, who knows? “Studio Sound” could be standard or maybe something for professionals to unlock as part of a monthly service pack. There are still a lot of questions to be answered during these heady beta days. Another question the company needs to answer is how much control to give the user upfront. I realize this seems like a no-brainer, but in the world of imaging, too much control can get average users quickly in over their heads. The ideal compromise for a majority of users is good quality out of the box, with additional manual user adjustments if you dig in. Auto white balance and skin tones are both challenges ahead for the company.  Image Credits: Brian Heater But on the whole, I’m satisfied with the image I got out of the box. I’ve done some tweaking, here and there. Having a ring light and natural lighting from windows helps, though I still find myself messing around with settings to get things where I want them. The camera employs an artificial bokeh effect, similar to the portrait mode you find on most modern smartphones (though the company says it developed its own, in-house). I’ve only got the slider about an eighth of the way at the moment, however. When it’s too intense, it tends to blur out my ears and the sides of my face, owing to the fact that there’s no depth cameras on-board. Opal says it experimented with a stereo camera for depth, but opted not to go with it for the sake of getting the device out in a timely manner. “I think at the end of the day, when you talk to users, they’re like, ‘just give me anything. I can’t deal with these Logitechs anymore,’” says Chugh. “So for us, speed was of the utmost importance, because we felt like we can ship something really good. We just need to be a little bit ruthless about prioritization.” For the C1, that also means no optical zoom. It seems like an odd complaint, perhaps, for a webcam, but it’s something I’ve grown fond of, while using a DSLR desktop setup. Being able to tightly crop a shot without degrading the image quality is huge.  Image Credits: Brian Heater “For the first camera, the more mechanical components you add, the more risk you have in the supply chain side and the manufacturing side,” says Sohlstrom. “It’s basically more to break. Canon has had maybe 50 years to get their lenses right. It’s definitely something that in the future we could do.” For now, the system is able to do 2x zoom in 1080p without degrading the image, courtesy of the 4K sensor. The company says it could theoretically do something like 20-30x, but picture quality is going to suffer accordingly. I used my call with the founders to, in part, give a little constructive feedback. For one thing, I’d love a straight-up zoom setting. For now, the closest thing is Facelock. It’s a feature similar to something like Apple’s Center Stage and similar features on smart displays from companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. It’s honestly way too sensitive, however, and could leave you a bit seasick. Hopefully in future editions, the company will let users adjust the sensitivity or just simply zoom in. These are both pretty easy fixes. There are so bigger issues. I found with apps like Google Hangouts and Zoom and I had to turn the camera off and on a few times and/or relaunch the software. The camera also gets really hot, even when it’s not active. The company blames this on both the system’s on-board processing and downscaling the 4K image. It’s working on fixes to the above.  Image Credits: Brian Heater For a product a brand new company started building less than a year ago, these feel like relatively minor complaints. I’m going to caution away from telling people to jump ship from their DSLRs — particularly if video quality is important to their jobs. But there’s so much promise here. The C1 is an extremely thoughtful product, from touches like a magnetic lens cap with a microfiber cloth and a coiled USB-C cable to more complex processing. This sure feels like the future of webcams, even if it’s still got a ways to get there."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/youtube-tv-warns-customers-they-may-lose-access-to-18-disney-owned-channels-by-weeks-end/","YouTube TV warns customers they may lose access to 18 Disney-owned channels by week’s end","","Fresh on the heels of resolving its months-long carriage dispute with Roku, YouTube now finds itself on the other side of the negotiating table. The company today warned its YouTube TV streaming subscribers they may lose access to all Disney-owned channels by the end of the week if the two companies are not able to reach a new distribution agreement. YouTube TV’s current contact with Disney ends on Friday, Dec. 17, the company noted. If a new deal isn’t struck by then, subscribers will lose access to 18 Disney-owned channels, including their local ABC station, ABC News Live, The Disney Channel, FX, ESPN and many others. This means customers would lose access to both the live streaming channels and the video-on-demand content, YouTube says. Other impacted channels include Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FXX, FXM, National Geographic, National Geographic Wild, ESPN2, ESPN3, ESPNU, ESPNews, SEC Network and ACC Network. In other words, failure to get a deal done will take out a large swath of YouTube TV’s programming lineup. The company says if that’s the case, it will try to make things right with users by lowering the monthly price for its streaming service. Instead of charging subscribers $64.99 per month, it would decrease its price by $15 to $49.99 per month for however long the Disney-owned content remains off its platform. The company also said that while it hopes every member will stay subscribed, it will allow customers to either pause or cancel the service if they choose, as usual. But if customers decide to stay with YouTube TV for its other programming, they could access Disney content directly through The Disney Bundle, a $13.99/month subscription. YouTube’s past negotiations with Roku appeared to be more about more than just the dollars and cents — Roku accused YouTube of asking for increased access to user data and preferred treatment on its platform. (Roku never said if it ultimately caved to those demands to get the deal done, though, leaving consumers in the dark as to what will happen with their user data!) But these Disney negotiations, on the other hand, seem to be breaking down over pricing — as these sorts of deals usually do. In the past, consumers didn’t always know when companies were butting heads, as the deals got settled in the final hours and the service remained uninterrupted. These days, it’s becoming more common to see companies leveraging the power of their customer base — and their collective outrage — as a negotiating tactic. That’s what Roku did over the past several months before it settled with YouTube on a new agreement. And that’s what YouTube, in turn, is doing now, to some extent — in addition to making sure customers know the service pricing will drop in the case a deal doesn’t get done. “Disney is an important partner for us and we’re in active conversations with them and working hard to keep their content on YouTube TV,” a YouTube blog post stated. “Our ask to Disney, as with all our partners, is to treat YouTube TV like any other TV provider — by offering us the same rates that services of a similar size pay, across Disney’s channels for as long as we carry them.” Update, 12/14/21, 4:25 p.m. EST; Disney shared the following statement with TechCrunch: Our contract with Google’s YouTube TV for the ABC Owned Television Stations, the ESPN networks, the Disney channels, Freeform, the FX networks and the National Geographic channels is due to expire on Friday, December 17 at 11:59 p.m. ET. Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution has a highly successful track record of negotiating such agreements with providers of all types and sizes across the country and is committed to working with Google to reach a fair, market-based agreement. We are optimistic that we can reach a deal and continue to provide their YouTube TV customers with our live sporting events and news coverage plus kids, family and general entertainment programming."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/cube-rm-raises-8m-round-led-by-runa-to-create-global-government-tenders-platform/","Cube RM raises $8M round, led by Runa, to create global government tenders platform","","There are millions of tenders and public sector contracts published every year by governments globally. The value of all this is estimated to be about $5 billion, and is expected to reach $9 billion by 2025. And of course, the pandemic has supercharged the need for digitized government procurement. But navigating government procurement portals is far from an easy task. There is currently no global platform to view all these tenders, while only legacy tools help with the application process. But a few years ago most countries in Europe and North America produced online tender portals, making it possible to scrape them at scale. And guess what? A startup has gone and done just that. Step forth Cube RM, which combines tender application and management into a single platform. The company claims to help enterprises discover, bid for and win tenders globally. It’s now completed an $8 million Series A round led by Runa Capital with the participation of the existing investor Marathon Venture Capital. The startup is mainly targeting pharmaceutical and medical equipment global companies, with plans to expand to other industries. So far, clients include Boston Scientific ($BSX), Takeda ($TYO), Kemira ($KEMIRA), Bavarian Nordic ($BAVA) and others. As well as helping companies discover new tenders globally, it also claims to prioritize tenders using Natural Language Processing; forecast tenders to be published; deliver tenders as opportunities in Salesforce.com; facilitate bid preparation and submission; and track tender winners and competitive info. Previously, co-founder Costas Economopoulos founded a few B2B software companies, while data scientist George Boretos was in the business software industry, and Philip Kytinos is an experienced software engineer. Economopoulos commented: While working with global life sciences customers, we discovered that 25% to 60% of their revenues comes from public sector tenders, which is rather significant considering the trillion-dollar size of the market. Previously, there was no software system to discover new tenders that are being published every day on a global scale and help those companies manage the processes for preparing their quotation and find the best price to win the tender with the use of the latest AI technology. Tender needs have historically been covered by either large revenue management solutions such as ModelN, Apttus/Conga or SAP. Konstantin Vinogradov, partner at Runa Capital, said: We have been investing in software solutions for regulated industries since 2011 and think that now is the perfect time for tender automation in the life science industry. On one hand, the pandemic boosted budgets and the overall importance of this industry, and on the other hand, it highlighted the ubiquitous lack of digitalization and abundance of inefficient bureaucratic processes at large enterprises. We consider this as an outstanding opportunity."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/the-irrational-exuberance-of-web3/","The irrational exuberance of web3","","This year’s hottest new tech terms are definitely “web3” and “metaverse.” The former refers to a decentralized web, based on the blockchain, while the latter is a combination of the internet and augmented and virtual reality. It is possible that we will see a merging of the concepts at some point. That is, if the concepts ever turn into anything. Suddenly, out of nowhere in 2021, we began using these terms like they were a given and we were all privy to the change. Like a giant game of social telephone, the blockchain became “web3” and AR and VR morphed into “the metaverse” — and we all went along for the ride. Yet the blockchain idea has existed for years as a concept, long before bitcoin decided to use it as a ledger for its digital currency idea in 2008. I began covering the notion of blockchain in the enterprise in 2017 when a colleague pointed out it could be the next big thing, a way to establish trust through an irrefutable record. It was interesting at first, but was often referred to as a solution looking for a problem, and I eventually lost interest. Here’s what I wrote in a 2018 article about the blockchain in the enterprise: The blockchain is in the middle of a major hype cycle at the moment, and that makes it hard for many people to take it seriously, but if you look at the core digital ledger technology, there is tremendous potential to change the way we think about trust in business. Yet these are still extremely early days and there are a number of missing pieces that need to be in place for the blockchain to really take off in the enterprise. At the time, I wrote about a number of promising startups. I talked to people in charge of blockchain at larger companies like IBM and SAP as they dabbled in the idea of bringing blockchain-based solutions for the enterprise. I was actually pretty pumped about it, too, until I realized it was more hype than reality and moved on. Three years later, it’s back, and once again, it’s the next big thing — and it’s got a new name to go with it. Stephen Diehl, an engineer and blogger from the U.K., sees the web3 moniker as pure repackaging of the same technology with the same issues. “At its core, web3 is a vapid marketing campaign that attempts to reframe the public’s negative associations of crypto assets into a false narrative about disruption of legacy tech company hegemony,” Diehl wrote in a December 4 blog post that pulled no punches. 7 investors discuss web3’s present and peer into its future  What he means is that web3 advocates say that decentralization could reduce the power of the biggest internet companies — Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook — and give it back to the users. But will it? Kevin Werbach, a Wharton professor and author of “The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust,” said that the technology might not be as far along as the hype, and the current popularity of digital assets doesn’t yet equate to a threat to Big Tech. “Web3 is, to some extent, a meme or marketing brand around a variety of blockchain and cryptocurrency activity, which was already happening. Like the enterprise blockchain wave of a few years ago, web3 is being hyped as much farther along in adoption than it truly is. Lots of people are trading crypto and buying NFTs, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are adopting distributed alternatives to major tech platforms,” he said. But Hilary Carter, VP of research at the Linux Foundation who spent three years at The Blockchain Research Institute in Toronto, sees a promising set of technologies that could be ready to scale to take on web3 hype. “Web3 simply could not even exist without the innovation that is blockchain. The road has not been easy, as the technology has been too often dismissed for some early failures. But those failures drove innovation to address issues like scale,” Carter told me. She said that the problems around scale and sustainability that I saw in my blockchain coverage several years ago have been solved in the ensuing years. “I think today, with those issues having been addressed, we’re seeing the maturity of the blockchain ecosystem, so much so that nation-states are building ‘central bank digital currency,’ which is probably the use case that will demand the most throughput,” she said. Certainly, financial institutions are embracing the technology. In its annual blockchain survey, Deloitte reported that nearly 80% of the respondents believed that digital assets would be important or somewhat important to their industries within the next two years. There is also a persistent belief that the speeding of digital transformation amid the pandemic is driving a corresponding shift to more widespread acceptance of digital currencies. While the idea of digital currency in an increasingly digital world certainly makes sense, it’s a bigger leap to say that the blockchain can support a broad set of use cases, including replacing current internet infrastructure, as supporters suggest. Diehl certainly doesn’t believe so. “On a compute basis, blockchain networks don’t scale except by becoming the very same plutocratic and centralized systems they allegedly were designed to replace,” he wrote. But Carter sees room for both digital currency and other use cases. “Sure. I do see both digital currency and blockchain implementations advancing significantly,” she said. Werbach adds that there are some promising examples, but there is reason to be skeptical about web3 as an overall concept. “New systems built from scratch, such as in DeFi (decentralized finance), don’t have the problem of legacy firms, but they face the challenge of scaling and mass adoption. Many so-called ‘web3’ solutions are not as decentralized as they seem, while others have yet to show they are scalable, secure and accessible enough for the mass market. That may change, but it’s not a given that all these limitations will be overcome,” he said. And there’s the rub. Whether web3 is a marketing slogan or a true technological trend, there is certainly a lot of money and tech behind it. Yet there are clearly still substantial obstacles and challenges ahead, and only time will tell if web3 can overcome them and live up to the latest hype cycle. The blockchain begins finding its way in the enterprise "

TikTok Jump is the short-form video app’s third-party integration tool that aims to deepen its relationships with third-party partners. When posting a video, TikTok users can now select Rotten Tomatoes from the list of available Jumps. From there, you can search for the movie or TV show that you’d like to link. Then, users will be presented with an “add to video” button. “Film and TV clips and soundbites have been high on TikTok’s For You feeds, with commenters often requesting more information on the content they’re discovering,” Rotten Tomatoes said in a press release. “With the new Rotten Tomatoes TikTok Jump, creators can easily inform and entertain audiences by accessing a treasure trove of movie, TV and streaming-related content, video, information on where to watch, reviews and more on Rotten Tomatoes.” The company’s partnership with TikTok allows it to reach more millennial and Gen Z users. Since launching TikTok Jump in June, the social media giant has partnered with many companies, such as Quizlet, Wikipedia, BuzzFeed and Jumprope, to allow them to create their own integrations within its app. Jumps can only be built by third-party providers after being approved through an application process. For a platform that doesn’t let all users include a link in their bio yet, TikTok Jump expands the existing tools creators have to engage their audience."

Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. Check back from now until the end of December for more!  This is a year where we’ve all had to reconsider our relationship with tech. Social media has finally been put on trial for its potential harms, including to vulnerable adolescents. Algorithms have been accused of dividing us and sending us down rabbit holes of extremism. Even tech companies with sizable “fan” bases, like Apple, have been seen in a new light as they’re challenged by antitrust lawsuits and investigations. For some, 2022 may mean looking to find a healthier balance with the sort of tech we’re using in our lives. In that light, we present a gift guide that’s focused on tech that allows us to escape tech!  Image Credits: Christoph Wagner (opens in a new window) / Getty Images AllTrails is a popular guide to over 200,000 outdoor trails, offering detailed maps, photos and reviews curated by millions of hikers and more. But the AllTrails Pro subscription is worth it for any dedicated hiker, biker or climber, as it offers downloadable maps — often necessary for off-the-grid hikes, as well as other handy features, like off-route notifications, a Lifeline feature that keeps safety contacts informed as to your trail progress and access to air quality, pollen and weather details on the maps. The company has big plans for the year ahead, too, thanks to its recent $150 million fundraise, which it plans to invest in further product development. Price: $29.99 per year or $59.99 for 3 years  Image Credits: Opal Phones can be distracting, taking us out of the moment and back into our screens. While recent updates like Apple’s Focus Mode feature have given us back some control, the Opal app takes things even further. The app, essentially a VPN client, lets you completely disconnect distracting apps so you can focus and easily set automatic schedules for things like work or family time where apps and notifications will leave you alone. Unlike some other tools, which can be disabled by the user, you can even configure “deep focus” sessions in Opal with a timer you can’t bypass for when you really need to not be distracted. You can use the app in a number of ways — on-demand when you need to concentrate or always on to help you craft better routines for your life with more boundaries. Price: A $40 Gift Subscription offers one year of Opal Pro  Image Credits: Light Phone When you really need to get off the grid, the best phone could be no phone. But that’s not always viable in this day and age where we need to be able to reach others in the event of an emergency or have them be able to reach us. Plus, we don’t really want to go back to the days of printing out our MapQuest directions, right? The Light Phone is another option, which could allow you to take a break without being fully disconnected. The phone allows you to make calls and texts and includes basic utilities like an alarm, calculator, a hotspot feature and a simple music and podcast player. It also just added a directions tool and will soon add support for public transit routes. The idea is to offer a phone that’s “smart” but not filled with addictive apps and games. The Light Phone may not make sense for everyone as their full-time device, but it could be swapped in for your weekend getaway or any other time you’re feeling too overwhelmed. The phone offers its own SIM plans on AT&T starting at $30/month for unlimited calls and texts with 1 GB of data, billed monthly with no commitment. But the phone itself is unlocked and will work with any compatible 4G VoLTE Nano-SIM (like the one in your current smartphone, probably.)

Speechify makes this possible. The web and mobile app lets you listen to anything with text — documents, news articles, research papers, school assignments, PDFs, emails and more — using a selection of natural-sounding AI voices. The app currently supports Gmail, Outlook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Google Docs, Notion, MS Teams, PDFs, Medium, NYT, BBC, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and LinkedIn. You can even snap photos of the pages in your books to have them read aloud. But this solution is not cheap — it’s more of a commitment to shift much of your screen-based reading to audio.

2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/coinbase-will-let-you-view-your-nft-collection-in-its-browser-wallet/","Coinbase will let you view your NFT collection in its browser wallet","","While Coinbase is better known for its cryptocurrency exchange, the company has also been working on a couple of self-custody wallets under the Coinbase Wallet brand. This type of wallets put you in charge of your crypto assets as private keys are stored on your devices. Today the company is bringing NFTs to the desktop browser. People who use Coinbase Wallet for desktop browsers will soon see a new tab called “NFTs,” which will let you access the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) associated with your wallet address. While many mobile wallets let you view your NFT collection, such as Rainbow, Argent and also Coinbase Wallet on mobile, browser extensions typically don’t have a native NFT gallery feature. The feature is rolling out in a few days.  Image Credits: Coinbase In addition to the new NFT feature, Coinbase has been working on better support for testnets and alternative networks. While you can already switch between multiple networks from the settings, Coinbase Wallet will now display your token balances across all supported networks, such as Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, Optimism, Polygon and xdai. It’s a sort of unified inbox for your crypto assets. Coinbase Wallet will also support EIP-3085 (EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal). If a Coinbase Wallet interacts with a decentralized application that also supports EIP-3085, it’ll lead to a better user experience for the end user. EIP-3085 allows dApp developers to suggest a specific network for a transaction. In other words, it makes it easier to interact with multiple networks. The main advantage of using a self-custody wallet is that you’re not limited to what’s available in the app. You can connect to a third-party dApp using WalletLink, WalletConnect, etc. But Coinbase has also integrated some decentralized exchanges directly in the Coinbase Wallet interface. Interestingly, Coinbase is using Uniswap and 0x for those trades. Coinbase collects a 1% fee on trades through its native DEX feature. In many ways, Coinbase Wallet feels like Coinbase’s web3 initiative. The company wants to remain relevant as crypto users become more and more educated and start interacting with more dApps. MetaMask has been quite popular with new crypto users who want to buy an NFT for the first time. But MetaMask users will tell you that MetaMask is … not great. And Coinbase doesn’t want to stand still. It has acqui-hired crypto wallet startup BRD and it plans to launch its own NFT marketplace. Disclosure: I own small amounts of various cryptocurrencies.

2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/7-investors-discuss-web3s-present-and-peer-into-its-future/","7 investors discuss web3’s present and peer into its future","'The genie is out of the box'|Lior Messika, founder and managing partner, Eden Block|Atul Ajoy, partner, Horseshoe Capital","Most people have experienced the internet only through Web 2.0: online applications, the social web and software as a service form the fabric of our lives. But even as other technology rapidly evolves, basic web infrastructure has remained largely unchanged since the turn of the millennium. Lately, many have championed web3 as the internet’s next phase, but the term encompasses so much territory, conversations can be rather diffuse. We’re still years away from web3 capturing major market share, and there are valid concerns that its complexity will daunt consumers and regulators. However, our research indicated that the investment landscape is growing increasingly competitive as venture capitalists become more educated and less skeptical. To get a clearer sense of where the market is, we reached out to several active investors to find out where web3 stands and what the future holds: To make things as clear as possible, we asked each respondent to share their elevator pitch: How would they describe the technology if they were trying to convince a skeptic to invest? Starting with the potential consumer appeal of cartoon apes, we tried to find out what specifically attracted them to invest in the semantic web and where they’re currently seeing demand. “I initially got into web3 through verifiable credentials and data provenance in the enterprise market,” said Atul Ajoy, a partner at Horseshoe Capital. Several others said they started exploring the space after developing an interest in crypto. In addition to discussing potential applications in advertising, fintech and enterprise apps, respondents shared their advice for web3 founders who are hunting for funding, along with their concerns about factors that could stall its development. Finally, we asked each respondent: What are skeptical web3 investors missing? “I never met a skeptical investor who actually understood what was going on. If you get it, you’re probably strapped in and ready to go,” said Lior Messika, founder and managing partner, Eden Block. “At this point, web3 has proven itself as more than a phenomenon — it is the foundational layer of the metaverse.” Please give us your web3 elevator pitch: What is it, and what role does it play in today’s internet framework?  In two sentences: Web3 is the key to the real metaverse. Web3 will house our financial institutions, social interactions, personal identities and much, much more in the not-so-distant future. Expanding: When I look at web3, I see an amalgam of decentralized infrastructure capable of powering a new world. The two most distinct properties of web3 are composability and decentralization. Firstly, crypto networks are swallowing up value and creating environments where every possible form of on-chain value interlinks and interacts with the other. Web3 has the unique ability to create tangible value systems out of value systems that remained intangible for millennia. It unlocks a world where our social capital, reputations, and historical interactions are given indelible and truthful assets — which often get priced into a market powered by decentralized protocols. Web3 is where all decentralized systems will learn to interact with each other, building on the security and value (thus network effects) of a broader ecosystem. It will be multilayered and multifaceted, supported by completely new infrastructure. Our applications will need to relay data reliably, transfer data completely privately, store data and maintain high levels of availability — all on decentralized rails. In web3’s short history, we’ve already seen how centralized infrastructure can be a dangerous tradeoff. What made you decide to get into the space? Cartoon apes and blockchain games don’t yet have broad consumer appeal: Where are you seeing demand for web3 products today?  Web3 symbolizes a massive societal shift, infused with innovation and supercharged with values. I dove headfirst into the space when I understood that we’re in the midst of a cultural revolution enabled by technology — not the other way around. Crypto and web3 is our technological answer to a societal problem that has plagued us for millenia, so I think that it’s natural for us to treat this movement with respect and passion. On products: Some of the most powerful web3 products that we’re seeing these days are intensely focused on ownership, creation and other contextual features that ultimately amount to our digital identities. Funnily enough, we’re already starting to see how crypto products are taking hold of our culture and of our shared attention. In the metaverse, your “pfp” is not only a skin of sorts but the key to another dimension. The individualism this basic feature enables over time explains the frenzied NFT market, which will undoubtedly remain a large part of web3 and the metaverse. The technological basis for NFTs will unlock disruptive value systems across gaming, fashion, social and creator economies. On a less obvious note, coordination in large, decentralized groups (DAOs) will require streamlined frameworks and transparent value systems. As communities grow and scale into multibillion-dollar networks, decentralized governance becomes very difficult. Colony and Coordinape will enable the next generation of DAOs through specialized tooling and automated frameworks for governance and incentives. What kinds of applications can we expect to reach the market in the near future? Where are you placing your bets, and can you name a few companies to watch? Within the broader context of web3, we see tremendous growth across two distinct layers in the stack — infrastructure and applications. Unlike TCP/IP (a core piece of internet infrastructure that cannot be monetized) at the dawn of the internet, decentralized protocols and baked-in incentive systems make running decentralized infrastructure extremely valuable. Technologies like the Pocket Network manifest this in full force, with billions of relays per week. The Pocket Network provides decentralized infrastructure to an entire ecosystem — and compensates its node runners handsomely for the work. At the current state of relays, the forecasted annualized revenue of the network is in the hundreds of millions. Another core piece of infrastructure for web3 is Biconomy. The Biconomy team is building transactional infrastructure for the decentralized web. Its platform abstracts away crypto transaction complexities for both developers and users. Biconomy has built a series of products that cater to developers building applications in web3 — as protocols continue to grow into mass producers of on-chain services, developers need tools to streamline their operations and integrations to allow for mass scale. On the application layer, I believe that we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of interoperable value systems within the broader web3 space. Through decentralized finance, we will one day price, value and monetize every single form of capital that can be linked to us on-chain. Our favorite art pieces will pay off our mortgage on lending protocols, and our “likes” will become financial assets. In simple terms, decentralized finance will kick-start the great monetization of everything. Protocols like Vega Protocol aim to enable decentralized derivatives at scale through fair and efficient markets. Another trillion-dollar opportunity in DeFi relates to a massive elephant in the room — since markets need stability to remain competitive and efficient, DeFi has largely sacrificed decentralization for stability, opting for the USD as the main underlying collateral for a huge portion of the market. Protocols like Float offer an alternative, by creating a low-volatility asset that can remain completely decentralized. Without a truly decentralized collateral in DeFi, web3 is at risk. Can you share a few of your top concerns? What are some of the pitfalls that could prevent web3 from realizing its potential?  Firstly, it must be understood that decentralization has to be the basis for all true innovation in what we refer to as web3. It is the common thread between every truly disruptive application in today’s cryptosphere: Uniswap and its many clones, money markets like Compound, Cryptopunks and Bored Apes, and storage solutions like Filecoin and IPFS — all enabled by one underlying property. Future developments across crypto networks will continue to leverage decentralization as a core enabler and build additional utility around it. In the absence of decentralization, disruption is stifled. For this reason, I believe that the biggest risk for us as we venture deeper into web3 is going back to how things were. Making easy tradeoffs that take us away from the very core premise of web3 — maximal decentralization, often at the cost of performance or scalability. What are some of the use cases and monetizable opportunities that will encourage major websites to switch over to web3? Will the prospect of increased internet regulation be a factor? Internet regulation is one extreme, but the more likely case is that web3 will swallow up enough value as it continues to grow for major websites to deem it necessary to switch over to web3. Web3 is akin to an economy, and most players will want to participate. Over the next decade, what are some of the major leaps you anticipate? Which aspects of web3 are overhyped? One major leap we will make as a society is to embrace true ownership. Financial freedom is deeply embedded in financial responsibility, and web3 is an interface to the most direct form of responsibility (and freedom) possible. On the topic of overhyped aspects of web3: I believe the radical openness and permissionless access across web3 open the door to a lot of experimentation and speculation. For this reason, most of the overhyped areas of web3 will actually be found at the bottom of the most valuable markets in the space. For example, looking at anything but the top 15-20 NFT projects and their associated communities is excruciating. In the long term, overhyped segments of the market will continue to act as a signal of where much of the innovation and broader focus currently stirs. How competitive is the web3 investment market today? What needs to be done to grow interest? The web3 investment market has never been more competitive. Investors are rallying behind developer teams with an idea and a bank account. I believe that while the capital continues to flow into the space so freely, the fundamentals remain the same yet the stakes (both in risk and upside) have never been higher. The amount of potential value in strong decentralized use cases is almost unimaginable, and teams are scouring the world for talent. To grow even more interest, the funding will have to eventually match talent and human capital, which currently seems extremely difficult to find. What advice would you give web3 founders who are trying to get their first check?  Web3 needs new leaders and will designate them organically as this ecosystem evolves. Nowadays, web3 founders take on the roles of communicators and community builders. In a world where development is open source and contributions are largely permissionless (more often the case in applications built on Ethereum), rallying an entire ecosystem to your cause becomes an extremely unique challenge. The core drivers for web3 are values-based and financially driven — thus, iterating on web3 will be a cultural and capitalistic mission. It will be incentivized by numbers, algorithms and code, and it will also be supercharged by brand, community and people. Web3 founders should internalize this and leverage that intimacy between developer and community to their advantage. Founders who clearly communicate the values and core missions of their project right from the outset will enable communities to form around that shared goal and propel the project into existence — and mass distribution. Without market intelligence, are they at a disadvantage when it comes to pitching? Without a certain amount of market intelligence, founders are severely disadvantaged. Web3 iterates so quickly and so sharply that even a few months of downtime can create fundamental knowledge gaps. In our investing practice, we see the stark difference between founders who are web3-native and those who haven’t taken the plunge yet. By now, it’s become clear that to build a successful product in web3, teams require a certain level of nativity to correctly identify gaps in the market, desires and needs of its user base, and much more. Do you know any skeptical investors? What do you think they’re missing? I never met a skeptical investor who actually understood what was going on. If you get it, you’re probably strapped in and ready to go. At this point, web3 has proven itself as more than a phenomenon — it is the foundational layer of the metaverse. Skeptical investors are probably missing the true meaning of Meta’s recent play, Zuck’s rather funny conversation with Gary Vee about NFTs and the general direction of digital life. Please give us your web3 elevator pitch: What is it, and what role does it play in today’s internet framework?  Web3 is a new decentralized form of the internet where users become owners. Today’s internet, Web 2.0, is largely controlled by centralized players who capture much of the monetary value created on the internet. Web3 replaces these centralized players with decentralized networks that distribute the value to developers, creators and users. This allows these network participants to design new incentive mechanisms in on-chain for organizations like DAOs. What made you decide to get into the space? Cartoon apes and blockchain games don’t yet have broad consumer appeal: Where are you seeing demand for web3 products today? 			"
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/andreessen-horowitz-backs-nft-investor-group-behind-one-of-a-kind-wu-tang-clan-album-purchase/","Andreessen Horowitz backs NFT investor group behind rare Wu-Tang Clan album purchase","","The crypto collective that bought Wu-Tang Clan’s “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin” album and an NFT of the original Doge image has a new member: venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The firm tells TechCrunch it has made an investment in PleasrDAO, a blockchain-aligned group of a few dozen crypto investors that have been teaming up to buy high-priced NFTs in recent months. The group’s purchases include the famous Doge image, which they bought for $4 million (1,696.9 ETH to be exact) then later fractionalized and sold to the crypto community (its current implied market cap is just above $100 million). The DAO also paid some $5.4 million for a work from Edward Snowden and $4 million for the Wu-Tang Clan album. A DAO (or decentralized autonomous organization) is basically a group organized formally around blockchain voting mechanisms to make decisions and invest capital. A16z Crypto’s investment in PleasrDAO is not their first publicly announced bet on the organization type. In October, the firm made an investment in Friends With Benefits (FWB) DAO, which they valued at $100 million. Andreessen Horowitz did not disclose the size of their investment in PleasrDAO though council member Santiago Santos specified their overall stake of the DAO’s governance tokens was “less than 5%.” Like many other crypto groups, PleasrDAO had a very singular ambition when it was formed — to bid on a work by a digital artist, in this case one by pplpleasr. Said work was an animated video advertisement for the decentralized exchange platform Uniswap. The group formed in March after crypto founder Leighton Cusack tweeted a link to the auction and asked, “Anyone want to create a quick DAO to bid on this???” The group eventually won the bid at 310 Eth (some $525,000 at the time) with all proceeds for the purchase going to charity. “Very quickly on, we thought, a lot of the smartest minds in DeFi are here — there is an opportunity to really take this in an interesting direction,” Santos tells TechCrunch. “I think, over time, the DAO grew to the point where we felt that we needed some more structure and hierarchy.” The group has since continued making investments and bulking up its portfolio while aiming to discover new artists that it can support. Santos says he has aims for the group to become a “Medici house” of NFTs “where a lot of digitally native artists can come and get initiated and discovered.” “DAOs are almost the purest manifestation of what web3 and crypto are all about,” a16z GP Ali Yahya tells TechCrunch. While a16z was early to crypto, the rise of so-called “crypto native” investment funds operating closer to founder and developer networks in the space has made it necessary for legacy firms like a16z to get bolder in backing new groups like DAOs. Andreessen Horowitz sees plenty of areas where they can help PleasrDAO including policy and regulatory concerns — an area where DAOs currently seem to be operating in a gray area of as unregulated investment funds of pooled capital. A16z’s bet on the group is, in many ways, a leveraged bet on NFTs, which the group has already bet heavily on. This year, the firm backed NFT marketplace OpenSea, NFT gaming giant Sky Mavis and NFT music platform Royal, among others. The firm also anchored Meta4 — a $100 million venture fund dedicated to buying up pricey NFTs. These investments are being made from the firm’s massive $2.2 billion crypto-centric fund, which the firm debuted this summer. “It’s easy to underestimate the potential of NFTs,” Yahya says. “It very well could be that NFTs will be enormous and that the total market cap of all NFTs down the line will actually be bigger than the market cap for fungible tokens.” A nine-figure fund for JPGs?

2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/space-florida-shrinking-rivian-stake/","Space Florida’s incredible shrinking Rivian stake","The state's economic development agency thought it owned 3% of EV behemoth Rivian. It was very, very wrong.","It would have been a legendary payoff for any investor, let alone a public agency: swapping an undrivable car for a multibillion-dollar stake in a hot new EV startup. Until last year, Space Florida, the state’s economic development agency for aerospace, believed that it owned 3% of Rivian as a result of a canny lease-back agreement made a decade earlier. Following Rivian’s blockbuster IPO in November, that stake would have been worth nearly $3 billion based on Rivian’s current market capitalization — a more than 1,000-fold return on Space Florida’s investment. That investment, which totaled nearly $2 million, included buying prototypes from Rivian in exchange for warrants in the company as well as the cost of buying the stock. Instead — and through a mechanism that neither the agency nor Rivian can explain — Space Florida has ended up holding just 60,000 shares in the company, worth less than $7 million, public records from the agency show. So why did a commercial space booster get involved with an EV pickup maker in the first place, and how did its supposed ownership evaporate? Space Florida began working with Rivian before it was called Rivian — and even before it was making electric vehicles. In 2009, RJ Scaringe founded Mainstream Motors as a spin-out from his father’s R&D firm in Rockledge, Florida. His original plan was to design an ultra-efficient gas-powered coupe capable of 60 miles per gallon and bring it into production in Florida using lightweight materials and modular manufacturing, all by the end of 2013. The Florida Energy and Climate Commission committed $2 million in seed money, enough for Scaringe to hire a small team to design a prototype. This is separate from Rivian’s deal with Space Florida. According to a Bloomberg report, the team then worked around the clock to produce plans for the vehicle, apart from its engine. When the plans were ready, they shipped them to a contract manufacturer in Detroit, along with a Mini Cooper for its powerplant. Scaringe then pulled off what must have seemed to be a stroke of genius. In June 2010, with the company’s first prototype still just a collection of custom and scavenged parts in Detroit, Scaringe sold it to Space Florida for $500,000. “Originally, there was a potential that it would bring an automobile manufacturing plant to Florida,” Dale Ketcham, VP of Space Florida, told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “But it was more the possible applications off-planet, whether on the moon or Mars, that piqued our interest.” When the first prototype, nicknamed “The Blue Thing,” arrived in Florida in October 2010, Space Florida immediately leased it back to Scaringe for $100 a year. The car was not ready to drive on public roads, let alone move into production, according to Bloomberg. But the company could use it for testing and demonstrations, including a (never-consummated) plan to speed-test it at NASA’s Shuttle Landing Facility in the Kennedy Space Center, records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show. After the 10-year lease was up, Scaringe could repurchase the vehicle from Space Florida for a final $100. But as an “additional consideration,” according to Space Florida documents, the startup would also issue to Space Florida a warrant to acquire 100 shares of its common stock, redeemable any time in the next decade, for $1,000 per share. “It’s one of the little things we’d done in the past with other organizations,” Ketcham recalled. “It gave us a little piece of the pie and it gave them some cash.” Space Florida also assisted the small company with business advice. Scaringe changed Mainstream Motors’ name to Avera. In March 2011, he changed it again — to Rivian — and persuaded Space Florida to repeat the deal. The agency would buy three more vehicles for $1 million, and once more lease them back to Rivian for $100 a year. This time, Rivian issued Space Florida a warrant for a further 200 shares, at $1,843 each. Which means if Space Florida wanted to redeem those shares it would cost them $368,600. It was a dark time for Rivian. Scaringe was scrambling for investors and down to a skeleton crew of employees. It took Rivian until June 2014 to complete the three promised vehicles, and months more to start the lease. Soon afterward, and following a big investment from Saudi Arabia, Scaringe relocated Rivian to Michigan, bought a factory in Illinois and put Florida in his rearview mirror. But he left a little bit of his company behind. Space Florida recorded the Rivian warrant agreements in its financial statement for the year 2013. The first warrant for 100 shares, it noted, “is estimated to equal a 1% ownership interest” in the company. The second, for 200, “is equal to a 2% ownership interest.” Space Florida believed its 300 shares represented a full 3% of the young startup, albeit one whose future was still uncertain. “We have our investment fund to make those kinds of investments,” Ketcham said. “Everything isn’t going to be a winner. If a company craters, then you’re S.O.L. like everyone else.” Rivian did not crater, however. In fact, its progress was little short of exponential, with hundreds of millions in funding flowing in from Amazon, Ford and Cox Automotive, then billions more from T. Rowe Price, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Ford and others.  Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe speaks in November 2018 before unveiling the company’s two first electric vehicles at an event at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. Image Credits: Getty/Phillip Faraone In 2018, Scaringe told TechCrunch: “We’ve got a good relationship with Space Florida. They hoped we would be able to manufacture there but as the company began to grow, the lack of automotive infrastructure became a problem. They do have a significant number of warrants, and I would imagine they’re quite pleased with the progress of the company given that those warrants are becoming quite valuable.” But how valuable exactly? Between 2013 and 2020, Space Florida accounted for those 300 warrants at their cost price of just under $1.5 million. In the meantime, Rivian’s valuation soared from the $10 million that the 2010 Space Florida transaction implied into the billions, and its stock split multiple times. (This means that even a handful of shares acquired in Rivian’s early days as a private company could have turned into many thousands as the company grew and eventually went public). All the while, Space Florida assumed that it still owned 3% of Rivian, according to public financial statements filed as late as October 2020. The warrants were finally executed in late 2020. The latest financial statement, issued by Space Florida in October, now shows the agency holding just 60,000 Rivian shares, worth less than $7 million. That is about 500 times less than a 3% stake would represent and less than half of what Space Florida would have earned if it had simply invested in the Nasdaq instead of Rivian a decade ago. “Something does feel a little weird here,” said Scott Orn, COO at Kruze Consulting, an accounting firm that specializes in funded early-stage companies. He notes that an early ownership interest can be diluted as bigger investors come on board, or be reduced by other strategies, such as recapitalizing the company. “But you’re going to go from, say, 10% ownership to 1% ownership,” he says. “You can’t wash them out completely.” Rivian would not comment on Space Florida’s warrant agreements or ownership stake, citing shareholder confidentiality. Space Florida did not dispute the figures in its financial statements but declined to comment on the value of its investment “pending board review of policy for these issues.” Ketcham predicted that “it will still prove to have been a very nice investment for the state.” Despite the large and somewhat mysterious discrepancy, Space Florida has no plans to pursue Rivian through the courts. “Our relationship with Rivian has been and remains excellent,” Ketcham said. “They did what they needed to do. And we want them to succeed as much as anything.” But the disappearances don’t end there: Neither organization could tell TechCrunch what happened to the four original prototype Rivian vehicles that nearly rewrote investing history."

Unlike Snapchat’s friend-to-friend, ephemeral messaging, Spotlight allows users to reach a wide audience. Since last year when Spotlight launched, Snap says that creators are posting three times as often now. It’s no secret that the race for short-form video dominance is underway. As TikTok became one of the fastest apps to reach 1 billion monthly active users, competitors like Snapchat Spotlight, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts rolled out creator funds to incentivize people to make content specifically for their platform. Instagram Reels won’t promote uploads with a TikTok watermark, while Snapchat reduced its original $1 million-per-day payouts because it was paying for too much “copycat content,” CEO Evan Spiegel said in September. Even platforms like LinkedIn, Spotify, Netflix, Reddit and Twitter are experimenting with TikTok-like feeds. Now, Snap says that 65% of Spotlight submissions use a Snapchat creative tool like an augmented reality lens — in particular the Cartoon Style 3D Lens, which went viral this summer, generated 2.8 billion impressions in just its first week on the app.  Image Credits: Snapchat Story Studio Snap is also catering toward creators with its Story Studio, a standalone app released at the Snap Partner Summit in May. Some creators edit their videos with tools like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere on their desktops, then send them to their phones — but Snap has tried to give users more flexibility. Story Studio lets creators do more intensive editing on their phone, while the Spotlight for web app allows users to upload their content without leaving their computers. Creators can also profit on Spotlight through in-app gifting and Snap’s creator marketplace, which allows brands to more easily collaborate with AR developers and influencers. Creators receive a share of the revenue from gifts, but they keep 100% of the revenue earned through the creator marketplace."

You’ll find times for all presentations listed in the event agenda, which will automatically reflect your specific time zone. Okay, let’s get to the, ahem, right stuff. Fast Money, Team Space: Company Concept, Capital and Customers —Disruptive and game-changing technology and entrepreneurial initiatives are the new space norm. However, a great technical design is not enough to sustain these entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing an idea across markets also takes capital and customers. Transitioning from concept to development phase is more likely to succeed when a company can obtain stable forms of capital and potential long-term customers. The Fast Money session focuses on how a startup identified the right venture partners to grow its business and secured opportunities to prototype and test its designs with the U.S. government. Presented by The Aerospace Corporation. New Kids on the Launch Block — There’s a new crop of launch companies nipping at the heels of SpaceX and Rocket Lab, including Astra, Firefly and Launcher. We’ll hear from their leaders about what the opportunities are in the evolving launch market, and how they’re posted to take advantage. Maneuvering Towards Better In-space Propulsion — What goes up must come down, but we can delay that second part a bit with better propulsion on our satellites and spacecraft. Accion Systems, Phase Four and Morpheus Space are pushing the boundaries of in-space propulsion and will discuss the challenges and opportunities in changing how in-space assets move about. Space SPACs and the Public Market — We saw a number of space companies go public this past year, and many took the SPAC merger route to get there. Redwire, Rocket Lab and Astra will talk about their respective paths to the public markets, and what it’s meant for their companies and the industry. That’s just part of what’s happening on day one of TC Sessions: Space 2021. Check out all the presentations and be sure to stop by the expo area to meet these 10 up-and-coming space startups. Go.

2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/cash-app-now-lets-users-gift-stock-and-bitcoin-using-their-usd-balance-or-a-debit-card/","Cash App now lets users ‘gift’ stock and bitcoin using their USD balance or a debit card","","There are already a number of ways to gift cryptocurrencies, but today Cash App will make doing so simpler with a new feature rolling out to its peer-to-peer payments app. The app, owned by Block (the company formerly known as Square) will now allow users in the U.S. to send bitcoin, as well as traditional stocks, as gifts to other U.S. Cash App users. While services like Stockpile and Coinbase allow users to gift stocks and cryptocurrencies, respectively, Cash App notes this is the first time such features have been offered in a peer-to-peer payments app.  Image Credits: Cash App To make this feature work, users will actually be sending the fiat value of the stock or the bitcoin from either their Cash App balance or a linked debit card, the company explains. While the earlier feature of sending bitcoin was accessed from the investing tab, the new feature is available both from the app’s payment tab or from a new “gift box” button on the investing tab. The recipient will then receive the market value of the asset at the time they accept the gift. But if they’d rather not take the stock or bitcoin “gift,” they can instead choose to receive the gift in USD. Of course, the launch arrives just in time for Cash App to capitalize on holiday gift-giving and could make for an easy last-minute gift. But the company notes users can now also choose to split bills and pay back friends by sending them stocks or bitcoin, not just cash. More importantly, perhaps, the feature may serve as a way for existing users to encourage newcomers to investing to get started with stock ownership or bitcoin via Cash App, as opposed to a competitor’s app.  Image Credits: Cash App Cash App isn’t the only peer-to-peer app that has expanded into the investing or crytpo market — its top rivals, PayPal and Venmo — also both offer the ability to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies. Plus, Venmo this year added the ability for credit card users to buy cryptocurrency with their cash back, as another means of pushing users to invest through its app. It had positioned the feature as a way for newcomers to enter the market without having to worry about the process of making cryptocurrency purchases. Similarly, Cash App’s gifting feature could help draw in other new investors who wouldn’t have necessarily sought out bitcoin investments on their own, but were invited to do so by a friend or family member. The new feature is launching today for Cash App users located in the U.S."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/apple-releases-tracker-detect-android-app-to-help-users-discover-unknown-nearby-airtags/","Apple releases ‘Tracker Detect’ Android app to help users discover unknown nearby AirTags","","Apple has released a new Android app called “Tracker Detect” to help people who don’t own Apple products to identity unexpected AirTags near them in an effort to boost privacy. If a user thinks they may be being tracked, they can use the app to scan for nearby AirTags. If the app finds any, it will flag it as an “unknown AirTag.” If a detected item tracker is known to be moving with a user for more than 10 minutes, users will be able to play a sound on the detected item tracker to help locate it. From there, the user will be given instructions on how to learn more about it and how to disable it by removing the battery. “Tracker Detect looks for item trackers that are separated from their owner and that are compatible with Apple’s Find My network,” the app description reads. “These item trackers include AirTag and compatible devices from other companies. If you think someone is using AirTag or another device to track your location, you can scan to try to find it.” At launch, the Tracker Detect app is compatible with supported Find My network supported item trackers, which include Apple’s AirTag and the Chipolo ONE Spot. It won’t work to find other non-Find My compatible trackers, like Tile, for example. It also can’t help users keep track of AirTags associated with an Apple account, so it can’t be used to actually take advantage of AirTags’ full capabilities. “AirTag provides industry-leading privacy and security features and today we are extending new capabilities to Android devices,” a spokesperson for Apple told TechCrunch in an email, confirming the new app’s launch. “Tracker Detect gives Android users the ability to scan for an AirTag or supported Find My enabled item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge.”  Image Credits: Apple Since the launch of Tracker Detect yesterday, the app’s page on the Google Play Store has been flooded with negative reviews. Many reviewers say the app would benefit from an automated detection feature instead of relying on users to manually scan for unknown AirTags. Other users have stated that the app has been unable to detect AirTags in their homes. It’s worth noting that the AirTag needs to be away from its paired device for at least 10 minutes before Tracker Detect is able to detect it and notify the user. TechCrunch has reached out to Apple for a comment. The launch of the new app follows concerns that Apple’s AirTag could be used to secretly track people, as they’re small enough to be discreetly placed in a bag or a coat. A Washington Post report from earlier this year explained how Apple’s AirTags made it easier to potentially stalk someone without them knowing. There were many other reports that also alleged that the tracking devices can be used to secretly surveil individuals. In response to these reports, the tech giant updated the time period after which an AirTag that is no longer with its owner will play a sound when moved. Originally set for three days at launch, Apple changed the time period to a randomized time between 8 and 24 hours. A user’s iPhone will also display an “Item Detected Near You” message if it detects an unknown AirTag near it, which means that iOS users don’t need a separate app to locate unknown AirTags. However, since there wasn’t a way for Android users to discover nearby unknown AirTags, Apple had also announced that it planned to launch an Android app to enable users to detect an AirTag that may be traveling with them. Apple launched AirTag earlier this year in April. They are priced at $29 each or $99 for a pack of four. The item tracking uses the company’s proprietary U1 ultra-wideband chip for what Apple calls “Precision Finding.” The device also uses Bluetooth LE (low-energy)."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/apple-launches-its-siri-only-apple-music-voice-plan-with-ios-15-2/","Apple launches its Siri-only Apple Music Voice Plan with iOS 15.2","","Apple is now rolling out access to its new, lower-cost Apple Music Voice plan, first introduced this fall at the company’s hardware event. The new service, designed largely for use with HomePod speakers or AirPods, limits consumers to accessing Apple Music using Siri commands. Due to its stripped-down nature, the voice-only service is offered at $4.99 per month, compared with $9.99 per month for a standard individual plan. The new music subscription is a part of the broader iOS 15.2 update, which also brings other features like app privacy reports, Message safety warnings for children, a “Hide My Email” privacy feature and more. Initially, some people may have been confused as to why anyone would want a music subscription designed only to be used by way of voice commands. But Apple was not the first company to go this route. In 2019, Amazon introduced a more affordable way to stream its Amazon Music service with the launch of a free, ad-supported tier that streamed only over its Echo speakers. In other words, it was a version of Amazon Music that could only be accessed by way of Alexa commands. Apple’s Siri-only service is similar, but isn’t restricted to Apple’s smart speakers alone. Instead, Apple says users will be able to request music using any of their Siri-enabled devices, including the HomePod, AirPods, iPhone or other devices, as well as CarPlay. The new voice-only tier isn’t a pared-down version of Apple Music with a limited song selection. Like traditional subscriptions, subscribers will gain access to Apple Music’s catalog of 90 million songs, its tens of thousands of playlists and its hundreds of new mood and activity playlists, personalized mixes and genre stations. It also includes Apple Music Radio. To access this content, users can request a song, album or artist via Siri, or, more likely, they can ask for a genre or type of playlist by using voice commands like “play something chill,” or “play the dinner party playlist” or even “play more like this.” Voice Plan subscribers can also use the Apple Music app to some extent. But instead of being able to browse across the full library, as usual, a “Listen Now” screen will present music they had recently played and will help them to discover more recommendations that can be played with either a tap or a Siri command. A Radio tab will offer access to live and on-demand radio. And there is a Search feature, but you can only play the results by asking Siri. The app will also include a section that teaches users how to optimize Siri for Apple Music. Users can give Siri specific feedback by saying things like “I like this song,” or “I don’t like this song,” and learn about the music being played by asking things like who sings a song, the song or album name, the release year and more. Over time, users who engage with Apple Music with their voice will be training Siri to better understand their preferences. That means they’ll be able to ask Siri to “play some music I like” or “play my favorites mix” and Siri, in theory, will deliver music they enjoy listening to. In addition to being competitive with Amazon’s Echo-only plan, the Apple Music Voice Plan could help Apple gain access to a trove of user data on Siri usage, which could help it to improve its product, which has lagged behind both Alexa and Google Assistant. More broadly, it’s also just an easy way for Apple to entice price-sensitive users to try out a paid music subscription service for the first time. Further down the road, the voice plan could lead these users into higher-priced tiers after they realize the convenience of having access to on-demand and ad-free music, instead of relying on a free, ad-supported option like Pandora. The Apple Music Voice is available via the iOS 15.2 update in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, the U.K. and the U.S."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/garner-health-raises-45m-series-b-for-totally-objective-doctor-review-service/","Garner Health raises $45M Series B for ‘totally objective’ doctor review service","","When you shop for a holiday gift, you probably read at least one review. Garner Health’s bet is when you look for a doctor, you’ll want to do the same thing — but you’ll find that existing reviews aren’t enough to go on.  Garner Health, founded in 2019, is a service designed to help people sort through doctors. The company contracts with employers who offer health plans to workers. Employees can search through Garner’s app for doctors in their area, particularly ones who have expertise in their particular issue. And, if employees use the service to select a doctor, they’ll unlock funds provided by employers to cover medical costs.  The company closed a $45 million Series B round on Tuesday, led by Redpoint Ventures. It includes participation from Founders Fund, Thrive Capital and Optum Ventures.  This round follows a Series A round raised in February, and brings the company’s total financing to $70 million, CEO and founder Nick Reber told TechCrunch. This includes previous investment from Sequoia Capital and Maverick Ventures.  Reber said interest in this round has been driven by a tenfold increase in Garner’s client base, savings on healthcare costs for employers and a high rate of employee use of Garner’s service.  “We’re, on average, saving 10% realized savings for our employers. And we’re getting over 40% of employees to use our tool to find a doctor. So we’re really proud of both of those numbers,” he said.  Garner Health’s doctor recommendations are compiled not from crowdsourced reviews, but rather, from medical claims data. Reber said that the company’s algorithms have combed through some 200 million patients’ worth of claims, and compared the procedures doctors are actually prescribing to those considered best practice in scientific literature.  “Working with the medical community, we’ve written over 500 different individual measures, of how doctors should treat different patients, and what are good health outcomes,” said Reber. “And we measure these individual behaviors in the claims data, and that gives us a lot more insight into how they practice who they’re keeping.”  The end result, per Reber, is a “totally objective” review system. Albeit, one that relies on the byzantine process of submitting medical claims. Medical claims have been used to conduct public health research, but there are some underlying problems with the approach: for example, medical claims may be incomplete, and certain conditions may not have billing codes, as one review points out.  It’s also easy to imagine that a system like this might privilege some doctors over others in unintended ways. If a doctor works with a community with high rates of underlying disease, or a community that’s already underserved medically, would that harm individual performance metrics, even if the doctor does the best they can?  Reber says his team is “obsessive about this.” His algorithms, he argues, will only compare doctors based on groups of comparable patients.  The second piece of Garner’s puzzle comes down to the way the company plans to work with employers. Part of the company’s promise is that if you select a doctor using the service, it will “unlock” funds provided by an employer to help cover out-of-pocket costs of the visit.  What’s the sell on that for employers? Reber’s pitch is that, already, companies are facing mounting healthcare costs and risk losing talent if they cut employee benefits.  Employers do see healthcare costs as a pain point. One survey of 300 large private employers conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 83% agreed that the cost of healthcare benefits was excessive (49% moderately agreed, 28% considerably agreed and 6% strongly agreed).  And, employers in general expect their healthcare costs to rise moderately next year — about 5%, per a survey conducted by benefits consultant Willis Towers Watson. This is, in part, driven by the fact that people will likely begin routine screenings and treatments that were once stalled during the pandemic’s first peaks.  Employers can go a few different routes to offset costs. Some are considering adding “spousal surcharges” to existing premiums, or may narrow the selection of in-network options, per the Willis Towers Watson survey. Other companies might pick up the slack themselves. Among the largest of the 1,502 employers surveyed by human resources consulting firm Mercer, 32% will actually decrease premium costs to employees in an attempt to retain talent.  Reber’s aim is to convince companies that Garner can help them stick with option 2: retain existing benefits, with the hope that directing patients toward certain specialists will cut long-term costs. So far, the company claims to have realized 10% savings for employers in terms of healthcare costs. And, to sweeten the deal for employees, employers use some of those savings to cover some of the out-of-pocket bills.  “The basic idea is we’re going to cover that deductible bill, that copay, that coinsurance bill. And when you do, we know more savings are going back to your employer, which means that total costs borne by the employer are going down,” said Reber.  So far, says Reber, Garner has worked with about 100 clients in 47 states. But with this current round, Garner will look to expand its client base. Garner’s platform works with both large and small companies, but Reber sees special opportunities for companies in the small to mid-size range. Those companies, Garner says, have often been left out of advanced benefits solutions.  The company has other plans for the round beyond expanding a client base. The company is also in the process of rolling out a “scorecard” service specifically for doctors and providers. For example, it might reveal that one doctor is performing more of a certain test, or has a higher level of complications among patients than a regional average.  That service is intended to give doctors insight into how their patients do relative to other specialists, or, for instance, help primary care physicians make referrals.  So far, this provider and doctor-based service is a small arm of the business. So far, Reber says that they’re piloting this service with “a few” large primary care groups, hospital systems and other multi-speciality providers.  Finally, the funding will also go toward improving Garner’s data science and analysis capacity."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/staircase-raises-18-million/","Staircase steps up effort to build the ‘AWS Marketplace for the mortgage industry’ with fresh $18M","","If you’ve ever had to apply for a mortgage, you know that it can be a time-consuming, expensive and often painful process — both in terms of just filling out the application and then waiting for the transaction to close. In recent years, a number of digital lenders have emerged to bring more technology to the process with the goal of making it all less tedious and slow. What we have seen less of are startups building the digital infrastructure to help these lenders deliver on a mortgage much faster than has historically been possible. Enter Staircase. The Philadelphia-based startup has developed an application programming interface (better known as an API) that aims to bring together the various parties involved in the mortgage origination process. By integrating all these different parties, Staircase is pledging to provide a better — and significantly faster — experience for the borrowers and the companies that are providing the mortgages. “The sheer number of entities and systems that must share and validate data to originate a loan makes it a complicated transaction. The lack of a universal language among all of these systems makes it even more difficult,” Staircase CEO and co-founder Adam Kalamchi. “What we are doing is creating an integration orchestration layer that brings all of those parties together and makes all these new mortgage-related technologies available instantly.” Let’s look at some numbers. It currently takes an average of 45 days to obtain a mortgage loan, and according to a recent report by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), total loan production expenses totaled an average of $9,140 per loan in the third quarter of 2021. Staircase says that its API can give every participant in the process a way to talk to one another “in just a few clicks” and thus, will bring down the time to get a mortgage to 10 days, and the cost to originate a loan to $1,000. Kalamchi (a former proptech investor) and co-founder Soofi Safavi (who worked for years in application development at JPMorgan Chase) started Staircase when they realized “there was no clean set of API infrastructure that was purpose-built for mortgage.” “Currently, there’s so many technologies out there that are amazing, but you have to integrate them one by one by one. And they’re all different,” Kalamchi told TechCrunch. “The thing we’re here to do is to make it better, faster and cheaper… Staircase is doing for the mortgage industry what AWS marketplace does for the enterprise. Like AWS, we want our product to stand on its own and be easy to integrate.” It’s a lofty claim. But one that a number of investors are willing to take a bet on. Staircase has closed on $18 million in a Series A funding round led by Bessemer Ventures, bringing the company’s total raised since its early 2020 inception to $24 million. RRE Ventures, Avid Ventures, Clocktower Technology Ventures, MetaProp Ventures and Zigg Capital also put money in the round. “As with many of our most successful developer platform investments at Bessemer and within the industry, the Staircase team has been doing the hard work to build a platform for developers that solves the most critical data, integration and workflow problems within the mortgage landscape,” said Charles Birnbaum, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “After getting to know Staircase since the company’s formation and working with early customers, we were excited to back them in this journey to help finally bring among the slowest movement segments of the financial services landscape into the cloud by making it easier to access modern solutions without completely replacing legacy systems.” One interesting thing about Staircase’s APIs is that its founders claim it won’t just help digital lenders, it can also help a wide range of entities including government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, employment verification services, first-generation mortgage technology providers like Ellie Mae and Black Knight, mortgage insurers, retail banks and wholesale banks. That too is appealing to Bessemer. “There have been some great new products that have enabled the mortgage industry to begin to provide more digital experiences to their end customers over the past several years but no true platform like Staircase to tie it all together and work with both innovative, digital-first as well as legacy providers in order to automate more of the process and leverage the cloud in the same way that many other segments of consumer financial services have already been doing for quite some time,” Birnbaum told TechCrunch. Looking ahead, Staircase plans to use its new capital in part toward hiring so it can continue developing its product. Out of 50 some employees, more than 40 are engineers. “It’s just all about product development, and maturation, and then going into the market and making sure the technology is helping borrowers,” Kalamchi said."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/toyotas-latest-ev-concepts-include-sports-cars-and-a-pickup/","Toyota’s latest EV concepts include sports cars and a pickup","","Toyota now aims to roll out 30 electric vehicles by 2030, expanding on its plan to sell 15 fully electric models by 2025. It gave a taste of the future by previewing a broad range of EV concepts during a presentation. Among those is a pickup, which could compete with the likes of Ford’s F-150 Lightning and Rivian’s R1T. As Autoblog notes, the Toyota Pickup EV looks very much like the Toyota Tacoma. As such, there could be an electric option for the next version of that pickup. Other models include a Sports EV and an FJ Cruiser-style Compact Cruiser EV. There are commercial models too, such as the Micro Box and Mid Box. Toyota once again showed off the self-driving e-Palette, which was used to transport athletes during this year’s Summer Olympic and Paralympic games. The company pulled them from use at the Paralympics after the EV hit a visually impaired athlete. At the higher end of the spectrum, Toyota also revealed a lineup of Lexus electric EV concepts. It said the Electrified Sport should be able to go from 0-60 MPH in just over two seconds and have a range of about 435 miles. The brand also showed off an Electrified Sedan and Electrified SUV. Although Toyota has now committed to spend around $70 billion on electrifying its vehicles, its medium-term projections for EVs are relatively conservative. It expects to sell around 3.5 million EVs per year by 2030, which is around a third of its current volume of vehicle sales. By contrast, Volkswagen estimates that, by that time, half of its vehicle sales will be electric models, and by 2040, the majority of its sales in major markets will be EVs. After becoming an early leader in hybrid vehicle tech, Toyota is playing catchup with other automakers in the EV market, so making comparatively muted projections shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise. Meanwhile, Toyota recently announced plans to build a $1.29 billion EV battery factory in North Carolina by 2025. The company last month declined to join other automakers, including GM and Ford, in pledging to phase out fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040. However, Lexus plans to only sell EVs by 2035.

2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pair-eyewear-focuses-in-on-adult-glasses-as-it-takes-in-60m/","Pair Eyewear focuses on adult glasses as it takes in $60M","","Purchasing new glasses used to be about finding the right pair that would go with everything until you needed the next set. Pair Eyewear turned that on its head with magnetic frames, called Top Frames, that enable glasses-wearers to change their style with any outfit or any occasion for as little as $25. Between 2020 and 2021, Pair grew its revenue 10 times year over year and attracted the attention of investors who pumped $60 million of new Series B funding into the company to give Pair $73.5 million in total funding. The round included investors like Rick Yang of NEA, NFL player Christian McCaffrey, Olivia Culpo, Sterling K. Brown and YouTube and professional gamer Ninja. We profiled Pair and its co-founders Sophia Edelstein and Nathan Kondamuri back in April when the company secured $12 million in Series A funding. At the time, the company was touting its magnetic base frame and interchangeable Top Frames for children. “One of our main priorities was to expand, and while we are focused on children, we launched a full adult collection and started growing,”  Edelstein told TechCrunch. “We were capitalized, but received so much investor interest. With how well the adult collection was doing and after meeting with Rick, it made sense to partner and put together more capital to grow.” Pair Eyewear raises $12M to bring more personality to your glasses  Since the Series A, the company secured licensing deals with brands like Marvel, Major League Baseball and Harry Potter. Pair Eyewear began 2020 with four people and now has 65 full-time employees, most of whom joined in 2021, Kondamuri said. In addition, more and more adults wanted Top Frames for their glasses as they purchased them for their children, so the company began its line of adult Top Frames, Edelstein said. The new capital will enable the company to continue growing, Kondamuri said. In 2022, the company intends on attracting a broader customer base, growing its team and offering unique products. In addition to current licensing agreements, the company will add more brands in the celebrity, art and sports areas to its list that also includes DC Comics and Sesame Street. What they also learned was that as Pair Eyewear leveraged more social media coverage, adults also were asking for a way to change their style on a continual basis.  Image Credits: Pair Eyewear “They want to match glasses to their outfits and moods, and we found that adults are even better customers because they purchase more rapidly for themselves,” Edelstein said. “We have customers that now own hundreds of tops, and there are now thousands of posts on TikTok of them switching them out on.” If Pair’s announcement is any indication, the direct-to-consumer eyewear market is doing quite well. Other companies are working to make glasses more hip, including Cheeterz Club, while Warby Parker found success when it made its public debut via direct listing in September. Edelstein believes Pair Eyewear’s differentiation is its razor blade business model, which brings back customers on a monthly basis as new styles drop. Yang says that at a macro level, Pair has enabled a new consumer fashion category and that in seeing how consumer behavior has changed over the years, there is organic excitement for what the company is doing. In fact, Pair’s recurring and repeatable business model is proof of why Yang himself owns the number of Top Frames that he does, Yang added. “It is one of those things where there is product market fit, but the more exciting piece is changing the way people think about eyewear,” he said. “What Pair is doing is not only in a capital efficient manner, but some of the numbers look software-like, and that is exciting. To me, the overlay of a big consumer trend they are riding, and in so many ways enabling, is an important part of our investment thesis.” Warby Parker makes it clear that direct listings are unicorn-friendly "
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/cma-mobile-ecosystem-market-study/","Apple and Google’s mobile duopoly likely to face UK antitrust action","","The U.K.’s antitrust watchdog has given the clearest signal yet that interventions under an upcoming reform of the country’s competition rules will target tech giants Apple and Google — including their duopolistic command of the mobile market, via iOS and Android; their respective app stores; and the browsers and services bundled with mobile devices running their OSes. So it could mean good news for third-party developers trying to get oxygen for alternatives to dominant Apple and Google apps and services down the line. Publishing the first part of a wide-ranging mobile ecosystem market study — which was announced this summer — the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said today that it has “provisionally” found Apple and Google have been able to leverage their market power to create “largely self-contained ecosystems”; and that the degree of lock-in they wield is damaging competition by making it “extremely difficult for any other firm to enter and compete meaningfully with a new system”. “The CMA is concerned that this is leading to less competition and meaningful choice for customers,” the watchdog writes in a press release. “People also appear to be missing out on the full benefit of innovative new products and services — such as so-called ‘web apps’ and new ways to play games through cloud services on iOS devices.” The regulator said it’s also concerned consumers could be facing higher prices versus what they would have to pay in a more competitive market, including for Apple phones, app subscriptions and purchases made within apps. The CMA’s study points to a now (very) familiar line-up of competition concerns attached to how the tech giants operate their platforms, and thereby maintain what its PR characterizes as a “vice-like grip” over mobile devices, including bundling services; self preferencing; restrictive T&Cs for third-party developers; and the 30% commission each platform can charge on some in-app payments. (Or what some irate third parties, such as Epic Games and Spotify, like to attack as the “Apple tax”; and Elon Musk has dubbed a “defacto global tax on the Internet”.) Separately, the CMA is investigating Apple’s App Store following complaints from developers of unfair terms — although that investigation is taking place under current U.K. competition rules. The regulator also has an ongoing intervention related to Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals; aka the latter’s plan to deprecate Chrome’s support for tracking cookies and switch to alternative ad targeting technologies — which has raised the ire of advertisers worried the move will further increase Google’s market power. And the CMA is in the midst of consulting on accepting a set of commitments from Google which would include a monitoring trustee in a bid to reassure the wider market that it’s playing fair. At the same time as this ongoing antitrust oversight of digital giants, the U.K. has an in-train plan to update competition rules — that’s aimed at addressing the market muscle of big tech. Specifically, ministers want to intervene to boost competition — proposing to tackle platform power through bespoke ex ante rules for tech giants.  But this major “pro-competition” digital reboot is still waiting the required legislation to get going.  As it waits for new powers to tackle platform power, the CMA has been busy enhancing its understanding of digital market dynamics. And, indeed, familiarizing itself with the usual tech giant talking points vis-à-vis charges of monopolistic/anti-competitive behavior. It also, of course, continues to hand down orders. “Both firms argue that many of these controls are needed to maintain the security and quality of the overall service to their users, and in some cases to safeguard users’ personal information,” the regulator writes now, anticipating push-back to its early mobile duopoly conclusions. “The CMA agrees that these considerations are very important but is concerned that Apple and Google are making decisions on these grounds that favour their own services and limit meaningful choice, when other approaches are available,” it warns. Potential remedies for tackling anti-competitive behavior by the mobile duopoly considered in the report include: The CMA is consulting on its initial findings — it’s soliciting market feedback by February 7, 2022. Apple and Google were contacted for a response to the study. (See the base of this post for their remarks.) Any actual U.K. antitrust intervention over the mobile duopoly looks to be on ice while the CMA waits for the competition reboot to kick in. And, specifically, for legislation to empower the Digital Markets Unit (DMU), which will be responsible for overseeing key parts of the incoming regime. Although, in further remarks today, the CMA writes that its “work so far suggests” both Apple and Google would “meet the incoming criteria for ‘Strategic Market Status’ (SMS) designation for several of their ecosystem activities”. Under the reform, SMS is the bar for ex ante competition interventions to kick in. But the DMU will be responsible for making a final call on which tech giants meet that threshold. Although the unit (which got going earlier this year) sits within the CMA, and will be drawing on the regulator’s expertise and past work in the digital sphere, so wildly divergent views seem unlikely. The UK’s plan to tackle Big Tech won’t be one-size fits all  SMS status will lead to Apple and Google facing “legally enforceable codes of conduct to govern their behaviour and to prevent them from exploiting their powerful positions”, the CMA writes now. “With this in mind, the CMA’s current view is that the firms’ market power in this area will be best dealt with through the DMU, which the government has recently proposed powers for,” it goes on, also noting it’s awaiting stronger competition and consumer law powers from the government (also recently consulted on). The CMA’s announcement also references the two aforementioned big tech probes, into Apple’s App Store and Google’s Privacy Sandbox, with the regulator noting: “While both examine issues falling within the scope of this study, this work into mobile ecosystems is much broader. The CMA will adopt a joined-up approach across all these related cases, to ensure the best outcomes for customers and other businesses.” It also hasn’t finished its deep dive into the mobile ecosystem: A second half of the study is ongoing, with the CMA expecting to publish a final report in June 2022. Whether the U.K.’s competition reboot will have been done and dusted by the middle of next year — meaning the DMU and CMA would be empowered to take steps to reconfigure the mobile duopoly — remains to be seen. In a public response to the CMA’s market study, an Apple spokesperson said: Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face intense competition in every segment in which we operate, and our North Star is always the trust of our users. We will continue to create new opportunities for developers while protecting our user’s privacy and security. Our rules and guidelines are constantly evolving, and we have made many recent changes that benefit developers and consumers alike. We will continue to engage constructively with the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority as their work on this study progresses. Cupertino also claimed the iOS App Economy in the U.K. supports more than 330,000 jobs. A Google spokesperson also sent us this statement: Android provides people with more choice than any other mobile platform in deciding which apps and app stores they use. The Android app ecosystem also supports nearly a quarter of a million jobs across thousands of app developer and phone maker businesses in the UK. At Google we regularly review how we can best support these businesses — for example — as a result of recent changes, 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. We’re committed to building thriving, open platforms that empower consumers and help developers succeed."

Users can now do so via the company’s Idea Pins feature. Pinterest launched Idea Pins earlier this year to allow creators to record and edit videos with up to 20 pages of content, using tools like voiceover recording, background music, transitions and other interactive elements. Now, when users find a comment they want to respond to, they can select the three dots menu and click “reply with an Idea Pin.” From there, you can choose to film a new video or upload an existing one. “There are more ways than ever to engage with your community on Pinterest. Now you can respond to all the comments, questions and requests with a tailored Idea Pin reply,” the company said in an announcement post about the new feature. “We wanted to spare you and your thumbs from the long, novel-text replies because some things are simply better when shown.” The launch of Pinterest’s new feature comes a few days after Instagram rolled out a similar one. Late last week, Instagram introduced a “Reels Visual Replies” feature that lets users reply to comments on posts with Reels. Now, when users choose to reply to a comment, they’ll see a new option that allows them to select the Reels button to create a video reply. It’s worth noting that the idea for video replies was first made popular by TikTok. The short-form video platform launched video replies last year to give users a way to offer more context about their videos and answer questions. Considering the popularity of the feature, it’s no surprise that Instagram and Pinterest have launched similar features for their own platforms. Pinterest has launched several new features aimed at creators over the past few months. The company further invested in creator tools and video with its acquisition of video creation and editing app Vochi for an undisclosed sum. Pinterest also rolled out a new way for users to browse Idea Pin videos in a TikTok-like “Watch” tab, where it encouraged participation with $20 million in creator awards. The launch of these features indicates that Pinterest is interested in trying to reinvent itself for the TikTok era, largely by copying TikTok features and then adding its own twists. Pinterest isn’t alone in doing so, as TikTok has fueled clones across top social media platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, Snap, Reddit and others."

Another day, another SPAC deal. We know. But this time we’re talking metaverse, so we have no choice but to take a look. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. In the wake of Facebook deciding that its original product remit was too narrow, something solved by declaring itself a metaverse company, the phrase has been inescapable. The metaverse might be a somewhat squidgy term — it’s something involving digital, community, commerce and having a second online existence — but it’s hot around the tech world. That makes it unsurprising that a company working on the theme has found a blank-check company willing to merge. What’s InfiniteWorld and what does it do? A grand question; I had no idea. Happily, the company’s investor deck helps a bit. Let’s look at the deal, what the metaverse company sells, and then discuss its somewhat humorous financial projections. To say that InfiniteWorld is a nascent commercial enterprise is an understatement, and in a world where many crypto companies are scaling to huge revenues, it stands out as a low-income concern. To date, that is. InfiniteWorld has huge projections. Let’s talk about it. Infinite Assets, Inc., better known as InfiniteWorld, is merging with Aries I Acquisition Corporation. Aries I is listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RAM.” As of this morning, the company is trading at roughly $10 per share, having regained modest lost ground since its midyear IPO. "

The startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic has attracted a number of new strategic and private investors, including suppliers Continental and ZF in a Series B $56.5 million fundraising round led by Orillion. AGCO, Canaan, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Airbus Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover’s InMotion Ventures and others participated in the round. Apex has raised a total of $74 million to date, a figure that includes previously announced investments from Volvo Group Venture Capital, Toyota Ventures and HELLA Ventures. Notably, ZF is taking a 5% stake in Apex. Investor appetite for companies like Apex has increased, as with the development of autonomous vehicles, and as the automotive industry has sought to build so-called “software-defined” vehicles that can deliver to drivers and passengers digital services capable of updating the software wirelessly — like a smartphone. As vehicles have become more complex, demand for a safety certified software development kit grows. Or at least that is what Apex and its many investors are betting on. “Apex.AI has cornered a unique market by making it easier for manufacturers to implement safety-critical software into mobility systems,” said Ahmed Sallam, partner at Orillion, who is also joining the board. “We also invested in Apex.ai because we see significant potential to expand the market for their operating system beyond the automotive industry and into other markets such as agriculture, robotics and internet of things (IoT).” More recently, the company has been working on an enterprise middleware product, called Apex.middleware, that integrates various protocols to improve communication between software applications. The fresh capital will be used to ramp up Apex in just about every way possible. Becker told TechCrunch the company plans to double its workforce from about 70 today to 140 by the end of next year, expand into Asia and commercialize its existing products and develop new ones in areas adjacent to the automotive industry, including agriculture, mining, industrial automation and internet of things (IoT). Former Panasonic executive Tavis Szeto will lead the Asia expansion."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/big-cartel-staff-are-voluntarily-recognized-as-the-latest-tech-workers-union/","Big Cartel staff are voluntarily recognized as the latest tech workers union","","Yesterday, e-commerce company Big Cartel’s co-founders Matt Wigham and Eric Turner voluntarily recognized the Big Cartel Workers Union. After the new year, the union — which represents all 30 non-management employees at the Salt Lake City-based tech company — will begin negotiating their contracts. This news comes just nine months after workers at the software company Glitch signed the tech industry’s first collective bargaining agreement. The Big Cartel Workers Union will be represented by the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Tech Workers Union Local 1010, the same group that represents unions at Kickstarter and Code for America. “It’s clear that the founders of Big Cartel want this union to be successful, and they see how all of our values line up,” said Andrew Shaw, who has worked in marketing for two years at Big Cartel. “I expect the bargaining can go pretty smoothly and quickly and continue to be a good example of how unionizing can go forward in a tech company in an amicable way.” We have officially won our union! After a signed voluntary recognition agreement and a successful card check, Big Cartel Workers Union is official! <U+0001F389> pic.twitter.com/Kx7AiuXvLR — Big Cartel Workers Union (@bcworkersunion) December 13, 2021  Often, unionization pushes are spurred by a particular moment of crisis. But in the case of Big Cartel, the movement to unionize stemmed from a desire to simply affirm and uphold workplace protections. “It’s really building protections around the things in our working conditions that we value, so ensuring that our pay is solid and equitable across genders, races and teams within the company, and making sure that our benefits are more guaranteed than they are now without a contract. We’re interested in more transparency and more participation in the decision-making processes for the company,” Shaw told TechCrunch. The Big Cartel Workers Union will also be the first tech union in a “right-to-work” state. Twenty-seven states, according to the OPEIU, have “right-to-work” laws, which prohibit union security agreements between employers and unions. This means that no employee can be forced to join a union or pay union dues, but sometimes, these policies can make it more difficult for employees to form unions in the first place. “So often in these companies, benefits just kind of come up [in conversation], or there has to be an individual conflict in order for you to work out some of these details,” Shaw said. “I’m excited to see that we can have these conversations without having to begin with a conflict, or without having to feel like it’s an urgent crisis moment.” Right now, workers at video game company Activision Blizzard are experiencing their own “urgent crisis moment.” This summer, the developer of games like “World of Warcraft” and “Call of Duty” was sued by state labor regulators for discriminatory workplace practices, and in September, the company confirmed it is being investigated by the SEC. Since then, over a thousand workers at Activision Blizzard signed a petition to remove CEO Bobby Kotrick, who reportedly covered up sexual assault allegations in the workplace. Last week, a group called A Better ABK initiated an open-ended strike and a union drive — already, executives have asked employees to “consider the consequences” of joining a union. But even in less extreme cases, the road can be rocky for tech workers who are starting to unionize. When Kickstarter employees formed a union in 2019, the crowdfunding company’s leadership refused to voluntarily recognize the unit. When management doesn’t recognize a workers’ union, the organizers must conduct an election through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) — in the case of the Kickstarter union, this process took 10 months before they ultimately voted to unionize. Just yesterday, workers at the controversial crime-tracking app Citizen voted to unionize over a year after unionization efforts began. Earlier this year, a spokesperson for Citizen told the New York Post that the company opposed the union drive. “We’re definitely inspired by our comrades at Code for America and Kickstarter,” Shaw told TechCrunch. “We want others to be inspired by the work that we’re doing because we want to make sure that not just the 30 people here at Big Cartel are protected, but that workers across all industries and across all companies are protected and treated fairly.”"
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/oppos-first-self-developed-chip-is-all-about-imaging-performance/","Oppo’s first self-developed chip is all about imaging performance","","Chinese smartphone giant Oppo revealed its first in-house chipset at its annual innovation event hosted in Shenzhen on Tuesday. The MariSilicon X chip announced — named after the Mariana Trench — is a neural processing unit that aims to boost photo and video performance through machine learning. The move adds Oppo to a list of smartphone makers that are designing their own chips, such as Apple. The MariSilicon project, headed by Qualcomm veteran Jiang Bo, started only in 2019. The silicon is being manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC)’s 6-nanometer process technology and will be featured in Oppo’s upcoming flagship handset in the first quarter of 2022. The ongoing global chip shortage will not affect the production of MariSilicon X, Jiang told the press at the event. Oppo also unveiled the third generation of its self-developed smart glasses, dubbing it an “assisted reality” device instead of an augmented reality one. The description is apt. The headpiece, which weighs just 30g, is reminiscent of Google Glass. It uses the Snapdragon 4100 chip, which is normally found in smartwatches, and it’s indeed limited to projecting 2D information such as navigation and translation onto its 1.3mm-thick glasses. It works as an extension of one’s smartphone, or like a smartwatch with a screen in front of one’s eyes, rather than an AR device that’s aware of one’s environment. It’s slated to ship next spring.  Oppo’s new “assisted reality” glasses. Image Credits: Oppo The third product unveiled is Oppo’s first folding phone, which came a year after its concept scrolling phone. The Find N, which has been in the making since 2018, is the result of six generations of iteration. When folded, the phone is about the size of an iPhone 12 mini and when open, has a practical landscape ratio so one doesn’t need to rotate it to watch videos. Made with Samsung display technology, the device touts its “creaseless” inner fold and competitive pricing at $1,200 in China, which is much more attractive than Huawei’s $2,500-plus offering. Interestingly, Oppo didn’t choose a local manufacturer like BOE, which suppliers Huawei’s OLED panels. Samsung itself has a comparable device, the Galazy Z Fold.  Find N is spearheaded by Pete Lau, OnePlus’s co-founder who was appointed Oppo’s chief product officer after OnePlus became Oppo’s subbrand this year. Before founding OnePlus, Lau was a director at Oppo’s old blu-ray division. OnePlus and Oppo were already sharing a supply chain prior to the merger but were operating independently. The merger has seen the two phone makers combining operational and R&D forces, including their operating systems, while the brands remain separate. OnePlus’s other co-founder, Carl Pei, has been drumming up buzz for his new earbud venture Nothing, which has won over investors and a horde of early followers. Oppo finished the third quarter with a 10% market share of global smartphone shipment, a tie with its sibling Vivo, which shares a lineage with Oppo for being offshoots of the BBK electronics empire. The two phone brands and BBK are still intricately linked today. The story was updated with details of the folding phone and BBK.

Today a startup that has built what it believes comes next is making some news with a large funding round, its first outside money. Guardio — which has built a browser extension that monitors for suspicious and malicious activity when you are on the web or using any digital service that interconnects using the internet (think messaging services, shopping and banking services and more, but for now no mobile services) — has picked up $47 million led by Tiger Global, with Emerge, Vintage, Cerca Partners, Union and Samsung Next also participating. The browser extension doesn’t impact on a computer’s or an internet connection’s latency, nor does it “just sit in the background,” CEO Amos Peled said in an interview. “We want to give advice and help to our users. We believe in positive friction.” As a bootstrapped startup, Tel Aviv-based Guardio, which was founded in 2018, has already amassed 1 million users for the extension, which is one reason why it was able to raise so much so early on. Peled — who co-founded the company with Daniel Sirota and Michael Vainshtein — said that the company typically has a detection rate of 73% in the first week for average users, where it has been able to identify activity that might be susceptible to data leakage, malicious extensions and other nefarious activity. (That number increases over time, it seems, as the system learns more.) Of the 1 million active users it has of its freemium product today, Peled said that some 100,000 are paying users, currently a mix of consumers and “micro” (i.e. very small) businesses. The plan will be to continue growing on both tracks and to continue expanding to a wider set of products. Geographically, the key focus for the company will be continuing growth in the U.S. market, where Peled notes there are some 17 million microbusinesses, companies that will not have dedicated security specialists or necessarily lots of resources to spend on security suites, but are just as susceptible to attacks, and perhaps even more in danger of falling over from them due to their size. The impetus for the company, Peled said, came out of the realization that many organizations of that size were already paying some money for security protection, but that most of it was legacy antivirus software and therefore not fit for purpose. “Attackers have adapted and they have shifted abuse to browser mechanisms, versus the old days of exploits or attacks on people’s operating systems,” he said. “The protection layers that have been there for a few decades, such as antivirus, didn’t quite adapt so there was a gap in the security landscape. A large percentage of users with updated operating systems” — which internconnect to the internet — “were using antivirus. So much was getting through.” We’ve seen a huge profusion of cybersecurity startups enter the market in the last several years, but much of the focus has been on enterprise deployments and securing the architecture particular to larger businesses or consumers, so what’s caught investors’ eyes here is the ability to build a product for the group sitting in the margin of these two, and to find some strong traction for that. This is the three founders’ second startup together. The first, Arpeely, they said specializes in real-time media auctions via machine and deep learning technologies. “The team’s combined expertise in Cyber, Product and Go-to-Market positions them perfectly to disrupt and innovate in this market. Their traction while bootstrapped is a testament to that,” said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global, in a statement."

The Washington, D.C.-based company leverages artificial intelligence in a tool for businesses to find global subject-matter expertise in real time, from both internal and external resources. Uzabase led the oversubscribed funding round and was joined by Teneo Ventures, Blu Ventures and a group of angel investors. This gives the company $9 million in total funding to date. Enquire, then known as GlobalWonks, was started in 2018 by Bilal Baloch, Cenk Sidar and Fatih Orhan after realizing that professionals are untapped resources. “To understand the regulatory environment in Kenya or public health in Indonesia, you have to know how to get that information,” COO Baloch told TechCrunch. “You might go to an expensive company that relied on an expert that was not on the ground there or the information was not fresh.” Instead, its Network Pulse technology taps into those “wonks” through a question-based tool where someone would ask a question and receive bite-sized answers in real time from more than 40,000 possible experts based on expertise tags. By providing short answers, it enables experts to take minutes versus hours and for an additional revenue stream for their expertise. Question-askers can also schedule additional time with experts to go more in depth on a topic. The name change to “Enquire” signifies the company going beyond the “wonks” into new abilities, like through API integrations in adjacent SaaS platforms, so that company employees can tap into the minds and insights of their colleagues, Baloch said. He estimates the expert network market is $1 billion, and with these new capabilities and name change, Enquire can jump into the market research market, which was projected to be valued at $73 billion in 2020. Indeed, other companies in this space are attracting venture capital as well. Last week, NewtonX raised $32 million for its tool aimed at democratizing access to high-quality data and research, while Wonder scales up a research team based on a topic. By going after the Series A funding the company wants to diversify its portfolio of knowledge technology offerings and will be deploying the new capital into team expansion, marketing and rolling out new API partnerships. Enquire works with 50 companies around the world and across them 300 clients. In the past 12 months, the company’s revenue grew by 300% and the expert network grew by 207%. “They are truly re-inventing how we receive and give expertise through technology and we’re glad to invest in a company that has the interest of all parties in mind, said Yusuke Umeda, co-founder of Uzabase, in a written statement. “This puts a significant value on research, resources and application of this data to make important decisions daily.” The unbundling of professional learning and entrepreneurship education "

On November 19, the California Department of Motor Vehicles notified Pony.ai that it was suspending its driverless testing permit following a reported collision in Fremont on October 28, the DMV told TechCrunch in a statement. Pony.ai has 10 Hyundai Kona electric cars registered under its driverless testing permit. This suspension does not impact Pony.ai’s permit for testing with a safety driver, said the DMV. According to Pony.ai’s collision report, the incident took place on a clear morning when its driverless vehicle was changing lanes using the autonomous mode. “Recently, one of our vehicles experienced an incident in Fremont, California, involving a collision with a lane divider and street sign. No other vehicles were involved and no injuries occurred,” a Pony.ai spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We immediately launched an investigation, and are in contact with the California DMV about the incident,” the spokesperson said. While other autonomous vehicles had reported crashes, most have occurred while the safety driver has been operating the vehicle manually or when another vehicle has struck an AV from behind. This incident stands out because the vehicle was in autonomous mode and didn’t involve any other vehicle. The incident puts a question mark on Pony.ai’s autonomous driving capabilities. The startup’s AVs have “successfully driven over 750,000 real-world miles in California since 2017,” said its spokesperson. Founded in 2016 by Baidu veterans, Pony.ai is among a group of AV startups that have R&D teams and testing fleets in both China and California. It has attracted heavyweight investors like Toyota and Sequoia Capital, with over $1 billion in total raise and a valuation of $5.3 billion as of February. Just recently, alongside Baidu, it was approved to operate commercial drivered autonomous cars within a demo zone in Beijing. The company has also faced obstacles in recent months. It had halted plans to list through a SPAC in New York after failing to reassure Beijing it would not be targeted by the U.S. government, Reuters reported in August. Last month, TechCrunch reported that the company’s autonomous trucking business had lost a few key executives, leaving the newly minted unit in limbo. As competition heats up, the startup has a lot to prove to its investors that it has competitive technologies and a viable commercial future.

This week, the company joins the booming world of home fitness with the XS1, a toned-down version of the commercial product designed to take on popular home strength training systems like Tonal and Tempo. The system features a 32-inch touchscreen and a wide range of strength training exercises that can be tuned up to 250 pounds. The system offers a wide range of workouts, including standard strength, rowing and pilates, accomplished with a variety of different add-on accessories. The company has long insisted that its approach to AI/robotics sets it apart from the growing range of home fitness platforms.

And with live events drawing to a close comes a good deal of collateral damage for all of the many facets of the industry such performances directly and indirectly support. Back in June, as things were tentatively reopening, Mixhalo CEO John Vars told TechCrunch that the low-latency, in-person audio streaming service used the pandemic as an opportunity to “step back and laser-focus on improving our core product.” With that came a pair of additions to its platform: Mixhalo Over Cellular and Mixhalo Rodeo. The exec adds, “We also found that with no live events on their calendars, venue operators had more time to talk about innovation and improving the fan experience. So, while business development suffered initially, as the year went on, we started to see the pipeline grow beyond even pre-pandemic levels.” Today, the company announced that it has raised a $24 million Series B. The raise, led by Fortress Investment, follows a 2019 $10.7 million A round. The company tells TechCrunch the funding will primarily go toward new hires and R&D. “It’s been a tough couple of years for the entertainment industry, but we’ve persevered by staying focused on improving our product while securing key partnerships along the way,” Vars said in a release. Lead investor Fortress Investment is also the firm behind TSX Broadway, a Times Square-based retail complex that features an outdoor stage and the standard sort of flashing lights you’d expect from that part of Manhattan.

The round was co-led by Creadev and Desert Bloom and included participation from Wheatsheaf and existing investors Beta Angels and InvestEco. Company founder and CEO Annie Ryu told TechCrunch the company had not done announcements of previous funding rounds and declined to disclose the company’s total raise to date, but did say this round “ was more than we raised in any prior rounds accumulatively.” The idea for jackfruit products came to Ryu 10 years ago while she was a medical student at Harvard. She and her brother had started a company, and during a trip to India, were introduced to jackfruit. Ryu learned that the fruit was drought resistant and high-yielding and while people ate as much as they wanted, she found that 70% of jackfruit went unused. With global health as her background, Ryu had a vision of halting poverty in this area by adding income for farmers by providing an outlet for the fruit to be used. Today, her brands work with 1,000 farming families with 10% to 40% of their income, she said. She then went about “pioneering the largest supply chain for jackfruit.” The first brand that emerged was The Jackfruit Co. in 2015 to provide foods that harnessed the fruit’s “meaty” texture and, through R&D, a meaty flavor, but packed with nutrients, protein and fiber. Boulder, Colorado-based The Jackfruit Co. sells about a dozen products, mainly targeting vegetarians. It started selling in Whole Foods and has since expanded. Now with jack & annie’s, launched in 2020, Ryu calls it a “super approachable brand,” featuring 10 easy-to-make frozen food items that have more meaty applications, like crumbles, meatballs and nuggets. Products retail from $4.99 to $5.99 in the frozen space and from $6.99 to $7.99 for refrigerated items. In the past few years, a few other companies emerged in the plant-based space using jackfruit as a base ingredient. Last year, Singapore-based Karana raised $1.7 million to develop plant-based pork made from the fruit. Upton’s Naturals produces meat alternatives using the fruit, as does The Very Good Butchers and Native Forest. In less than a year, the brand expanded into more than 1,500 locations in retailers, including Whole Foods, Sprouts, Meijer, Wegman’s, Hannaford, Target and Giant. It is also the third-largest frozen brand in the plant-based category and the top nugget in the natural channel for the 12 weeks ending October 3, according to SPINS Natural Channel, Ryu said. The company continues to double its revenue on a yearly basis and will use the new funding to continue to build out partnerships and new innovation, expand its footprint on shelves and increase total distribution. “Jackfruit has the amazing ability to mimic beef, pork, chicken and seafood, so we are at the tip of the iceberg with what we can show,” Ryu added. “Part of what we are doing with leadership is be an innovation partner to major customers, so if they are looking to leverage the meaty texture and to have meat items more delicious with a clear ingredient deck, we can work with them at our R&D center in Boulder.” Chinese startups rush to bring alternative protein to people’s plates "

Many companies collect a ton of data with some location element tied to it. Carto lets you display that data on interactive maps so that you can more easily compare, optimize, balance and make decisions. Insight Partners is leading today’s round. The European Investment Found is also participating, as well as some of the company’s existing investors, such as Accel, Salesforce Ventures, Hearst Ventures, Earlybird and Kibo. A lot of companies have been working on their data strategy to gain some insights. First, they adopt a data warehouse to centralize all current and historical data under the same roof. Companies use products like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery or Snowflake. After that, there are different business intelligence, reporting and data visualization tools that help you take advantage of the data that you have stored in your warehouse. This is where Carto comes along with a product specialized on spatial analytics. Carto can ingest data from multiple sources. You can upload local files for historical data, but you can also connect to live data directly. Carto provides connectors with databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server), cloud storage services (Dropbox, Box or Google Drive) or data warehouses (Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery or Snowflake). “In the last three years, we have seen the rise of the data warehouse and we have gone from almost no architecture being based on a data warehouse to becoming the dominant implementation,” Carto CEO Luis Sanz told me. “That’s why we have focused on building Carto as a spatial extension on top of all the major data warehouses, because we see that the trend is just accelerating.” After that, you can go through your data using SQL queries and enrich your data. In particular, you can take advantage of Carto’s own data catalog. The company has compiled around 10,000 data sets from both open data sources and private providers — around 3,600 data sets are open data. When everything is set up, you get an interactive dashboard. You can move around a map, select and unselect layers and see the real numbers. Essentially, it should feel like playing Cities Skylines. Customers use Carto to find out where they should open their next store, to prioritize some areas for their out-of-home advertising budget, to optimize their supply chain or to deploy cell towers in the right areas. That’s why Carto has managed to convince a wide variety of clients, such as local governments, banks, consumer packaged goods companies, credit card networks or infrastructure companies working in transport, utilities or telecommunications. “The rise of the data warehouse has allowed organizations to unify and connect all their data in a single location, and geospatial data is no exception,” Sanz said in a statement. “Now, thanks to our cloud native offering, they can also perform spatial analytics on top of them. Our Spatial Extension runs on top of all the major data warehouses and takes full advantage of all their benefits, giving our users a complete suite for geospatial analysis that is highly performant, scalable and secure.” Essentially, Carto is benefiting from the move to data warehouses and digital transformation in general. As more companies move to the cloud, those companies become potential Carto customers."

The committee broadly welcomes the government’s push to go beyond industry self regulation by enforcing compliance with a set of rules intended to hold tech giants accountable for the content they spread and monetize — including via a series of codes of practice and with the media regulator, Ofcom, given a new major oversight and enforcement role over Internet content. In a statement accompanying the report, the joint committee on the draft Online Safety Bill’s chair, Damian Collins, said: “The Committee were unanimous in their conclusion that we need to call time on the Wild West online. What’s illegal offline should be regulated online. For too long, big tech has gotten away with being the land of the lawless. A lack of regulation online has left too many people vulnerable to abuse, fraud, violence and in some cases even loss of life. “The Committee has set out recommendations to bring more offences clearly within the scope of the Online Safety Bill, give Ofcom the power in law to set minimum safety standards for the services they will regulate, and to take enforcement action against companies if they don’t comply. “The era of self-regulation for big tech has come to an end. The companies are clearly responsible for services they have designed and profit from, and need to be held to account for the decisions they make.” <U+0001F195> Our report on the #OnlineSafetyBill is out <U+0001F4D8> 5 months. 50 witnesses. 200 submissions. 190 pages. <U+0001F449> Read our full cross-party, cross-Chamber report https://t.co/xzBjer9JRK <U+0001F449> Read a summary of our unanimous recommendations https://t.co/ebUVFtg1Wg pic.twitter.com/eYkS9EyHaC — Joint Committee on the Draft Online Safety Bill (@OnlineSafetyCom) December 14, 2021  The committee backs the overarching premise that what’s illegal offline should be illegal online — but it’s concerned that the bill, as drafted, will fall short of delivering on that, warning in a summary of its recommendations: “A law aimed at online safety that does not require companies to act on, for example, misogynistic abuse or stirring up hatred against disabled people would not be credible. Leaving such abuse unregulated would itself be deeply damaging to freedom of speech online.” To ensure the legislation is doing what’s claimed on the tin (aka, making platforms accountable for major safety issues), the committee wants Ofcom to be “required to issue a binding Code of Practice to assist providers in identifying, reporting on and acting on illegal content, in addition to those on terrorism and child sexual exploitation and abuse content”. Here MPs and peers are pushing for the bill to take a more comprehensive approach to tackling illegal content in what can be contested areas of hate speech, arguing that regulatory guidance from a public body will “provide an additional safeguard for freedom of expression in how providers fulfil this requirement”. In earlier iterations the legislative plan was given the government shorthand “Online Harms” — and the draft continues to target a very broad array of content for regulation, from stuff that’s already explicitly illegal (such as terrorism or child sexual abuse material) to unpleasant but (currently) legal content such as certain types of abuse or content that celebrates self harm. Critics have therefore warned that the bill poses huge risks to free speech and freedom of expression online as platforms will face the threat of massive fines (and even criminal liability for execs) for failing to comply with an inherently subjective concept of “harm” baked into U.K. law. To simplify compliance and avoid the risk of major sanctions, platforms may simply opt to purge challenging content entirely (or take other disproportionate measures), rather than risk being accused of exposing children to inappropriate/harmful content — so the committee is trying to find a way to ensure a public interest interpretation (i.e. of what content should be regulated) in order to shrink the risks the bill poses to democratic freedoms. Despite the bill attracting huge controversy on the digital rights and speech front, where critics argue it will introduce a new form of censorship, there is broad, cross-party parliamentary support for regulating tech giants. So — in theory — the government can expect few problems getting the legislation through parliament. This is hardly surprising. Internet giants like Facebook have spent years torching goodwill with lawmakers all over the world (and especially in the U.K.); and are widely deemed to have failed to self regulate given a neverending parade of content scandals — from data misuse for opaque voter targeting (Cambridge Analytica); to the hate and abuse direct at people on platforms like Twitter (U.K. footballers have, for example, been recently campaigning against racist abuse on social media); to suicide and self-harm content circulating on Instagram — all of which has been compounded by recent revelations from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, which included the disclosure of internal research suggesting Instagram can be toxic for teens. All of which is reflected in a pithy opener the committee pens to summarize its report: “Self-regulation of online services has failed.” “The Online Safety Bill is a key step forward for democratic societies to bring accountability and responsibility to the internet,” it goes on, adding: “Our recommendations strengthen two core principles of responsible internet governance: that online services should be held accountable for the design and operation of their systems; and that regulation should be governed by a democratic legislature and an independent regulator — not Silicon Valley. “We want the Online Safety Bill to be easy to understand for service providers and the public alike. We want it to have clear objectives, that lead into precise duties on the providers, with robust powers for the regulator to act when the platforms fail to meet those legal and regulatory requirements.” Facebook knows Instagram harms teens. Now, its plan to open the app to kids looks worse than ever  The committee is suggesting the creation of a series of new criminal offences in relation to what it describes as “harmful online activities” — such as “encouraging serious self-harm”; cyberflashing (aka the sending of unsolicited nudes); and comms that are intended to stir up hatred against those with protected characteristics) — with parliamentarians endorsing recommendations by the Law Commission to modernise comms offences and hate crime laws to take account of an age of algorithmic amplification. So the committee is pushing for the (too) subjective notion of “harmful” content to be tightened to stuff that’s explicitly defined in law as illegal — to avoid the risk of tech companies being left to interpret too fuzzy rules themselves at the expense of hard won democratic freedoms. If the government picks up on that suggestion it would be a major improvement. In another intervention, the committee has revived the thorny issue of age checks for accessing porn websites — and preventing kids from accessing adult content online is something the U.K. has been trying (and failing) to figure out how to do for over a decade — by suggesting: “All statutory requirements on user-to-user services, for both adults and children, should also apply to Internet Society Services likely to be accessed by children, as defined by the Age Appropriate Design Code“; and arguing that the change would “ensure all pornographic websites would have to prevent children from accessing their content”. Back in 2019 the government quietly dropped an earlier plan to introduce mandatory age checks for accessing adult websites — saying it wanted to take a more comprehensive approach to protecting children from online harms via what’s now called the Online Safety Bill. However child safety campaigners want the bill to go further — and so, it seems, does the joint committee; albeit in a “proportionate” way. “We want all online services likely to be accessed by children to take proportionate steps to protect them,” the committee writes. “Extreme pornography is particularly prevalent online and far too many children encounter it — often unwittingly. Privacy-protecting age assurance technologies are part of the solution but are inadequate by themselves. They need to be accompanied by robust requirements to protect children, for example from cross-platform harm, and a mandatory Code of Practice that will set out what is expected. Age assurance, which can include age verification, should be used in a proportionate way and be subject to binding minimum standards to prevent it being used to collect unnecessary data.” UK now expects compliance with children’s privacy design code  Other recommendations pick up on specific suggestions made by Facebook whistleblower Haugen in her testimony to U.K. lawmakers earlier this fall, with the committee calling for the law to include a requirement on service providers to conduct internal risk assessments to record “reasonable foreseeable threats to user safety”; and further specifying this should include “the potential harmful impact of algorithms, not just content” [emphasis theirs]. The committee is also urging ministers to extend the scope of the bill to include scams and fraud that stem from paid-for advertising (not merely user-generated content scams) — an issue that’s faced high-profile campaigning by U.K. consumer advice personality Martin Lewis, who previously sued Facebook for defamation over scam investments ads misusing his image. U.K. lawmakers further suggest individual internet users should be able to make complaints to an ombudsman when platforms fail to comply with the new law — and recommend that regulated platforms are required to have a senior manager at board level or reporting to the board who is designated the “Safety Controller.” “In that role they would be made liable for a new offence: The failure to comply with their obligations as regulated service providers when there is clear evidence of repeated and systemic failings that result in a significant risk of serious harm to users,” the committee suggests. While the suggestions are not binding on the government, during her own recent evidence session to the committee last month, the secretary of state for digital, Nadine Dorries, told lawmakers she’s “open” to their suggestions for improving legislation which she argued will change Internet culture for good — further predicting “huge kickback” from platforms that have got used to being able to mark their own homework. “I believe that there will be huge, huge [change],” she said. “This will set off a culture change in terms of our online environments and landscape. There will be huge kickback. Because you have to follow the money — people are making a huge amount of money from these platforms and sites. And of course there will be kickback. But we must not forget the world is watching what we are doing in terms of legislating to hold those platforms to account. That is why it has to be watertight.” Law and digital rights experts, meanwhile, have given a cautious thumbs up to the committee’s intervention — while continuing to warn that the bill itself still poses major risks to online freedoms, and also looks set to usher in nightmarishly complex compliance regime for U.K. internet services… Based on a *very* quick skim, the report of the Joint Committee on the Draft #OnlineSafetyBill contains thoughtful conclusions, but, even if fully adopted, they’d still lead to a stifling piece of legislation, too complex for most in-scope organisations. https://t.co/I3RqhaegNo — Neil Brown (@neil_neilzone) December 14, 2021  Ex-minister predicts ‘huge battleground’ over UK’s plan to set internet content rules  UK warns Facebook to focus on safety as minister eyes faster criminal sanctions for tech CEOs  UK publishes draft Online Safety Bill "
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/vay-raises-95m-to-bring-teledriven-self-driving-transportation-service-to-hamburg-in-2022/","Self-driving startup Vay to launch commercial teledriven service in Hamburg in 2022","","Vay, a company that is trying to get self-driving car services to market faster by pursuing a teledriven approach, has raised a $95 million Series B round to help it launch its first commercial service in Hamburg, Germany sometime in 2022. The startup plans to offer a transportation service where a user can order a car to be delivered to their door, drive the car themselves to their destination and then just hop out, leaving the job of parking it to the remote operator. New investors Kinnevik, Coatue and Eurazeo participated in the round alongside existing investors Atomico, La Famiglia and Creandum. Other participants include Project A, Visionaries Club and Signals, as well as former Alphabet CFO Patrick Pichette and Spotify board member Cristina Stenbeck. The funds will also be used to triple headcount, particularly in the engineering department, as Vay scales out its teledrive and driverless tech and launches in more cities in Europe and the U.S., according to the company.  The Berlin-based startup came out of stealth in September after working for the last two years on its teledriven technology, which allows remote operators, who are Vay employees currently based in Germany, to pilot vehicles to customers. If the launch goes according to plan, Vay might be one of the first to offer a “driverless” commercial service in Europe, but it’s not without serious competition. Mobileye, an Intel company that is expected to go public next year, recently announced a partnership with rental car giant Sixt SE to launch a robotaxi service in Munich with Moovit, an Israeli transit tech company. While the Mobileye service won’t be commercial at first, the plan is to scale it across Germany and other European countries throughout the decade. Germany is quickly becoming the place to start European autonomous operations because the country adopted legislation in May that would allow driverless vehicles on public roads by 2022 without a human safety operator behind the wheel. Intel’s Mobileye, rental giant Sixt to launch a robotaxi service in Germany next year  Vay’s service will launch initially as a teledriven one that gradually introduces autonomous features, an approach the company said will create real revenues faster than other industry strategies while ensuring high levels of safety. While most other AV companies are aiming to launch fully autonomous commercial services from the get-go, Vay’s strategy is already quite common in the robotic sidewalk delivery space, where companies like Serve Robotics, Coco and Tortoise are using teleoperations to establish partnerships and enter markets faster than waiting for fully autonomous tech and favorable regulations to settle in. “We think this is the most pragmatic solution as we are able to put an autonomous driving experience in the hands of customers in a matter of months, allowing us to accumulate highly valuable data that will be utilized in building the most informed and safe autonomous driving service in the market,” a spokesperson for Vay told TechCrunch. “We will be able to start automating parts of our mobility stack as soon as our initial fleet of cars are on public streets.” Remote operated systems often have trouble with cell latency, which could cause a delay in driver reaction time. Vay said it uses technology that minimizes the chance of latency events, but on the off chance one occurs, the car will have enough autonomy to pull itself over. Other autonomous features, which are being trained on teledriving data, will be launched in a step-by-step approach, the company says. “For example, we can start with solving simpler features such as driving straight on highways autonomously,” said the spokesperson. “Whereas more complex driving tasks such as intersections, off-ramps of highways and other complex maneuvers would still be done by a teledriver.” Vay declined to share how large its initial fleet in Hamburg would be, but did say it would be a small fleet accessible to a restricted group of customers. Over time, the company plans to sequentially expand its geofenced operating design domain, add more vehicles to its fleet and offer the service to more customers. “Our vision is to become as present and available on public streets as popular ride-hailing services, which is why we are already working very closely with the city of Hamburg and other cities in Europe and the U.S. to ensure the best path to public transport integration and endorsement,” said the Vay spokesperson. Once the service has launched, customers will be able to book a VayCar via the Vay app, which will result in the arrival of a branded electric Kia e-Niros. Vay plans to establish partnerships with others in the auto industry ahead of its expansion into new cities in the coming years, the company said. Vay still needs to acquire regulatory approval in order to launch, which might be why the company declined to provide a more specific launch date next year. The company is still in its final testing and validation stages with a technical certification authority, said the spokesperson, which is the basis for regulatory approval to get its fleet on roads. Vay’s vehicles will rely primarily on cameras that enable the teledriver to have a 360-degree view of the environment, but the cars will also have ultrasonic and radar sensors for assisted safety features, like emergency brake systems. The teledrivers will have access to “augmented skills,” which means other road users, like pedestrians or cyclists, will be highlighted in the video stream for the drivers to improve safety. Vay doesn’t use expensive lidar sensors, which it says allows it to “bring down costs into the thousands rather than tens or even hundreds of thousands for Level 4 autonomous driving companies,” and makes for a highly scalable solution. Whether or not the unit economics of this will pan out is hard to say. Without lidar sensors, it’s debatable that Vay will even be able to achieve Level 4 autonomy, which SAE describes as a system that can drive itself without needing a human to jump in. And by using teledrivers, each of which will be limited to driving one vehicle at a time, it’s not clear how Vay is bringing down the cost of paying a human to drive. A Vay spokesperson said that teledrivers are only present for about 33% of a trip, using the example of it taking five minutes to bring the car to the customer, 20 minutes for the customer to drive themselves and another five minutes to telepark the car or bring it to the next customer. “Hence, we can make this much more affordable than ride hailing where a driver is physically bound to the car before, during and after the ride,” said the spokesperson. Vay did not respond in time to further requests for clarification as to how this makes for a cheaper service, especially given the 1:1 relationship between teledriver and vehicle. Vay also says its service will “cost a fraction of existing ride-hailing services.” Given the above example, Vay even estimates its service can be 50% lower than the price of a ride-hailing service, a number that will only further reduce as the company reaches competitiveness with the cost of urban car ownership. It will be interesting to see if scaling this rather unique model can actually lead to the operating cost savings Vay is hoping for."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/mesh-payments-racks-up-50m-to-help-corporate-users-manage-spend-and-payments/","Mesh Payments racks up $50M to help corporate users manage spend and payments","","Now that the world appears to have settled longer-term into working in a significantly more distributed way in the wake of COVID-19, companies are getting more serious about using tools to manage how their teams operate within those new parameters. Today, a startup that’s addressing that challenge and how it relates specifically to expenses is announcing some funding. The round, a Series B, is being led by the very prolific Tiger Global, with participation also from Entrée Capital and Falcon Edge Capital, as well as past backers TLV Partners and Meron Capital. Mesh Payments — founded in Israel and now headquartered in New York — had previously raised $13 million, and it is not disclosing valuation. Currently the company’s tools cover areas like travel expenses, spend cards and other forms of spend management, but potentially the more interesting aspect of how Mesh works lies in its name. Mesh Payments’ platform integrates with various other pieces of software and apps that a company might use to run its business, and continually scans that network to determine whether a particular purchase is a useful one, or one that might be overlapping with something that already exists, not to mention not in line with other parts of a company’s specific expenditure policy. “We start with the notion that there is different context to different kinds of spend,” Oded Zehavi, co-founder and CEO of Mesh Payments, said in an interview. “The process for a trip versus software differs, so we started building models for these unique cases.” Today, the platform integrates with the likes of QuickBooks, Slack, NetSuite, Xero, G Suite from Google and more. “We are adding more connectors to connect data from organizations’ services on the cloud to be exposed to more company behavior,” he said. “The combination of that data and the intelligence that we designed in a more superior way is what sets us apart.” So, for example, if an employee suddenly decides to set up an iCloud storage subscription, Mesh would scan the network to determine if that fits with corporate policy, and would also set out to see if the organization already has an account with another cloud storage company. If either of those questions raises a flag, the purchase is flagged, too. Employees get notifications of these, as do spend managers on the finance team. It’s up to the finance team to decide how strict they would like the policy to be: whether purchases are blocked, or rejected in the aftermath, or issued with a warning/alert. Understandably, the system requires some substantial onramping from customers: they have to already be working in a digital enough way in order for Mesh’s modelling to work to its best ability. So unsurprisingly, the current customer list is heavy with technology companies, which are already working in the cloud and thus representing an easy port to working with Mesh: Monday.com, Hippo Insurance, Sezzle, Riskified and Snyk are on the list. As recent rounds for Pleo (which raised at a $4.7 billion valuation just last week) and Soldo (which raised $180 million in July) show, there is currently a huge appetite in the market for better and more updated tools for managing expenses, both at a time when employees may be needing to spend more independently than before because of how they’re working, but also because companies are simply looking to get smarter and come to grips with the systems and financial management they have in place. Mesh’s focus on larger businesses gives it a very wide funnel, targeting an area that has been particularly rife with legacy tools from companies like SAP (although to be fair they are all focusing on improving user experience and tapping into modern technology more). Nevertheless, it’s a massive opportunity that is likely to stay, just like at least some of our newly distributed working practices. “Mesh Payments is an example of a true disruptor — a company who’s innovations are transforming an already-established industry,” said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global who led this investment, in a statement. “We’re proud to support a business that continues to deliver on its ambitions, and we look forward to helping Mesh modernize the payments space even further.”"
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/google-backed-neobank-open-acquires-finin-for-10-million/","Google-backed neobank Open acquires Finin for $10 million","","Open has acquired consumer neobanking startup Finin for $10 million as the Bangalore-based, Google-backed business-focused neobanking platform looks to broaden its offerings and deepen relationships with banks. The deal involves both cash and stock, the two said. Launched in 2019, Finin is among the first consumer-focused neobanking startups in India. The startup, which had raised about $1 million from Unicorn India Ventures and others, will see key executives, including the founder and chief executive Suman Gandham, move to Open. Anish Achuthan, co-founder and chief executive of Open, told TechCrunch in an interview that the acquisition of Finin complements Open’s broader offerings. Open, which recently received backing from Google and Temasek, operates an SME banking platform and also provides banks with infrastructure to launch their own digital banks. More than a dozen banks today use Open’s infrastructure to offer their banking services. Open currently has partnerships with 14 banks in India and a few more in Southeast Asia. Finin offers a savings account that allows consumers to save and invest their money. “Finin complements our offerings to banks. We will now help banks launch their own consumer-focused neobanking offerings under their own brand names,” he said. “There are many banks that are looking to launch their own modern platforms.” Open still plans to continue to focus on its enterprise offerings to banks and isn’t looking to launch a consumer-focused neobanking service, he said. “Direct-to-consumer is not in our DNA,” he said. “But as part of our SME offerings such as payroll management, we may complement some B2C features.” “When we first launched Finin, I promised my squad that we would make a hallmark in the fintech industry, and show Indian consumers what neo-banking can really do for them,” said Gandham in a statement. “Now with the acquisition by Open, I’m absolutely convinced that we are speeding towards that goal. The outcome of a consumer-facing neo-banking platform working hand-in-hand with a B2B neo-banking platform is going be exemplary as we will be able to add a lot of value to Open’s SMEs wanting to open salary accounts for employees, expose consumer banking rails to fintechs using Open’s embedded finance platform Zwitch, and also add value to banks wanting to launch digital banking propositions using Open’s cloud native digital banking OS BankingStack.”"
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/superside-nabs-30m-to-connect-and-manage-freelance-creatives-working-with-in-house-marketing-and-design-teams/","Superside nabs $30M to connect and manage freelance creatives working with in-house marketing and design teams","","As advertising and marketing become increasingly automated and thus commoditized, design has emerged as a savior to help brands stand out. And today, a startup that’s helping companies connect with a wider range of designers and other creatives to meet that demand is announcing a round of funding to fuel its business growth. Superside, which operates a network of freelance creatives that are tapped by companies to work on logos, display ads, packaging, bigger marketing campaigns and other design-based efforts, has picked up $30 million, money that it will be investing in further international expansion and growing its team of people, both in-house staff and the creatives network. Prosus Ventures and Lugard Road Capital are co-leading the round, with previous investors Slack Fund and Acequia Capital also participating. Investors and the company would not confirm but I understand from sources valuation to be just over $400 million. The round is the first sizable funding that Oslo-based, but very distributed, Superside has raised — it was founded as Konsus back in 2015 and had picked up only $5.5 million up to now — and it comes on the heels of some impressive growth in its nearly-bootstrapped state. Its customers include the likes of Amazon, Facebook, Salesforce, Cisco, Shopify and Coinbase. “Really, any hot company in the Valley,” Fredrik Thomassen, Superside’s co-founder and CEO, told me in his understated, Norwegian-accented clip the other day. (This helps downplay the words, which come off as matter-of-fact rather than boastful as a result.) You’d think that a company like Amazon or Facebook would have no end of people on in-house teams to handle whatever design need might arise, but in fact, no matter how big or small an organization is, there is always something that will need an extra pair of creative hands, especially these days. Superside provides them. Those hands, meanwhile, are set to multiply. Thomassen tells me that the company currently has 500 on its “team” — his word to include both those working on staff (150 people) and the wider creatives network (350). “It’s important for us to think of us all in the same boat and creating equal opportunities globally,” he said. Creatives are freelancers technically, though, and thus free to do whatever they want, although the idea, he said, is that Superside provides them with enough engagement, interesting work and non-frustrating tools to manage it all to make it less likely that they would turn to 99designs, Fiverr, Upwork or any of the other platforms that might provide them with gigs elsewhere. The plan will be to expand that network in earnest in the coming months. “We want to go from 350 to 1,000 creatives,” he said, “and then maybe 10,000, or 100,000.” (Again, you have to read this thinking of Thomassen’s understated clip, which makes all this sound perfectly reasonable.) Design — and in this case branding, advertising and other fields that have been described traditionally in the industry as “creative” work done by creatives — has faced a massive evolution in the digital age: most if not all work is carried out on software; more often than not, it is intended to be consumed on digital screens; and the nature of global, localized campaigns created by virtue of digital mediums mean that there is simply a lot more creative work needing to be done. Added to this, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, designers long ago cut their tether to the office, working remotely, putting in extra hours at home even when they do not, picking up side-hustles where they never meet clients in person, and so on. All of this has played neatly into the creation of really excellent design software, designed to be used, edited, shared and consumed in the cloud, and it’s played neatly too into the hand of companies like Superside to build platforms to help connect creatives to opportunities. Superside itself has focused its technology development on making that engagement and following through on work as seamless as possible, with very specific project management software that it has designed itself to manage the processes, including remuneration and related accounting alongside the steps around seeking people, engaging them and working through projects. It has not built design tools up to now, and it has no plans to. “We are using exclusively established tools,” said Thomassen. “It’s much more difficult to build competitors to companies like Figma and Adobe. We are incredibly bullish on Figma especially, since it’s a less closed system than Adobe’s.” It will be interesting to see whether Superside sticks to that, or whether it becomes an attractive company to tap for those big firms that are taking on Adobe and building more bridges to creatives alongside the creative tools themselves. (Adobe’s ownership of Behance, which gives it a kind of link into those networks of creatives already, implies it might not be in the running if that were the case.) In the meantime, what sets the company apart is how well it has identified the shortcomings of working with alternatives — Thomassen himself comes from a marketing background and said he built Superside specifically out of his own frustrations in trying to find, engage and work with creatives — and built a platform to solve that. “What sets Superside apart from all the other players in the creative economy is their long-term approach to solving the underlying problems of marketing and creative teams,” said Mats Diedrichsen, the former CMO of Delivery Hero, who is joining the board with this round. “I believe Superside has the potential to become the ‘agency-killer’ while truly levelling the playing field for creatives all over the world.” Superside has seen significant growth in the last few years, working with reputable brands, including Amazon, Salesforce and Cisco, that have consistently praised Superside’s fast turnaround times, creative diversity, high-quality content and impressive access to global top talent. Long-time customer Amir Jaffari, Growth lead at Shopify, summarized: “Superside makes it easy for Shopify’s Growth team to get design done quickly without impacting the quality. Their platform is intuitive and enables speed, and the dedicated team model ensures everyone thoroughly understands our brand and day-to-day needs, allowing for scale.” “As the need for high-quality, fast-turnaround digital content continues to rise, and companies look for increasing brand distinction, Superside is fulfilling the demand by offering a unique subscription that provides fast, flexible and diverse design from some of the world’s top creative talent,” added Sandeep Bakshi, head of European investments at Prosus Ventures, in a statement. “In addition, as the pandemic has accelerated the momentum of flexible and independent work, Superside is highly attractive for creative team members, offering remote, flexible, and high paying jobs, allowing them to work with top brands globally. We believe Superside can usher in a new era of creative solutions for top companies globally, and are excited to partner with them on this vision.”"

Image Credits: BHub Founded in June, the Brazil-based company provides what it calls “back-office-as-a-service,” which includes bookkeeping, CFO services, legal and HR services so entrepreneurs can focus on their core business, Jorge Vargas Neto, founder and CEO of BHub, told TechCrunch. BHub is Neto’s third company and his third in the financial sector. He was previously CEO of Zen Finance, which was sold to Rappi in 2020, and Biva, which sold to PagSeguro in 2017, he said. While integrating with Rappi, Zen Finance was told by its accounting firm that it had to pay capital gains taxation, which ended up requiring the company to redo all of its bookkeeping in 10 days. “It was hellish, but I’m grateful for that experience because I became passionate about how I could help people avoid the same hurdles in Brazil and Latin America,” Neto added. “We tested the market by inviting entrepreneurs to talk about their hurdles of administering business. Some 500 people RSVP’d, and we ended up doing 300 interviews that enabled us to see the pain points and to come up with our vision for a solution.” Neto explained that in Brazil, hundreds of thousands of businesses closed in 2020, driven partly by the global pandemic and partly by little financial literacy. Brazilian legislation requires every business owner to have a third-party accountant. The market is reserved for them, and they are protected by the law, “so they don’t have to be that good,” he added. Where the typical accounting firm doesn’t use much technology, this is BHub’s “magic spot,” to provide a service based on a technology approach and with startups in mind, he said. The Series A came fast for the company due to a combination of factors: achieving early product market fit, steady growth over a period of three months and high referral rates by customers. The company counts 134 companies as customers and looks to hire 100 people across engineering, technical, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing and customer service. “Considering the growth we’ve had and what we project we will do, we need to enhance the team of 51 people and grow to 2,000, 2,500 customers by next year,” Neto added. “We do think if we keep up the pace we will get there.” 5 factors that can make or break a startup’s growth journey "

The round was led by London-based specialized investor Insurtech Gateway, with participation from Rockstart’s AgriFood fund and others. Microinsurance typically refers to offering coverage to low-income people against a specific class of risks. In IBISA’s case, these are small farmers whose livelihoods might be affected by adverse climate events, which are unfortunately on the rise. While based in Luxembourg, the startup is focused on emerging markets, with a partnership-based approach. “We work with mutuals, insurers, microfinance institutions, research institutions, farmers and breeders associations and governments,” its site explains. Since being founded in 2019, the company has worked with partners in the Philippines, India and Niger. It now plans to use its funding to hire and expand its presence in existing and new markets. It’s easy to see why farmers might be relieved to get compensated when their crops get damaged. But there are also several reasons for them not to have agricultural insurance — most of them don’t, according to IBISA. On one hand, options might be too costly; on the other, paperwork to claim a payout might be too daunting. This is where technology comes in: IBISA’s payouts are meant to be quick and hassle-free, because rather than requesting individual claims, it relies on a collective index. That’s index-based insurance, also known as parametric insurance, since payouts are triggered by a certain parameter — for instance, notice of catastrophic weather events. This approach also helps reduce operating costs on the insurer’s side, making lower rates worth offering, said Insurtech Gateway‘s co-founder Stephen Brittain. “Historically, microinsurance was not commercially viable due to many reasons such as low premiums, expensive claims handling, challenging distribution and a lack of trust.” What changed? Again, technology. If IBISA and others put trust into an index, it’s because it is supported by data. Its co-founder and CEO María Mateo Iborra worked for several years in the satellite industry, and a key element of the startup’s approach is its reliance on orbit images to assess damage. In addition, it relies on crowdsourced data from local “watchers.” Space tech and crowdsourcing aside, there’s also a blockchain element to IBISA, which sees it as a way to keep costs low. Its name actually stands for “Inclusive Blockchain Insurance Using Space Assets,” and it has been accelerated by the European Union’s blockchain-focused project Block.IS. The company also recently presented itself at Rockstart‘s AgriFood demo day. At the time of joining the program last September, IBISA’s co-founder Jean-Baptiste Pleynet made mention of IBISA’s insurance, satellite and blockchain components, as well as of its potential to drive positive impact. But Pleynet also emphasized an interesting point of synergy: “We believe our solution will be very valuable for the food industry to bring resilience to the supply chain and manage climate risks and we wanted to accelerate this path,” he explained."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/e-scooter-company-tier-acquires-wind-mobilitys-italian-subsidiary/","E-scooter company Tier acquires Wind Mobility’s Italian subsidiary","","Tier, a Berlin-based e-scooter company that’s quickly expanding throughout Europe, has acquired Vento Mobility, the Italian subsidiary of Wind Mobility. The companies are not sharing the terms of the deal, but it will mark Tier’s entry into the Italian market. Just last month, Tier also acquired Nextbike, a German bike-sharing platform, a move to both become multi-modal and further consolidate its micromobility empire. Since its founding, Tier has also acquired Makery, a provider of digital services like product strategy, design and management, engineering, testing and quality, training and support, and staff augmentation, as well as Pushme, a battery swapping company. On the Wind side of things, the company also recently sold off its Israeli operations to Yandex, the Russian tech giant, so it’s possible Wind is succumbing piece by piece to the inevitable industry consolidation. The company has raised a total of $72 million; its last funding round was a Series A back in 2019. Tier, for comparison, raised $200 million as only part of its Series D round in October, bringing its total funding up to around $647 million. Wind did not respond to TechCrunch’s inquiry for more information about its strategy moving forward. As of Tuesday, the first Tier e-scooters will be available on the streets of Bari and Palermo, with other Italian cities to follow in the coming days and weeks, according to the company. Tier is already present in 165 cities in 18 countries, offering its scooters that include an integrated helmet, turn signals on the handlebar and rear wing, and triple brakes with a large front wheel. Wind’s Italian fleet had 4,500 e-scooters across 11 towns and cities in Italy. Tier said it would not take over Wind’s fleet, and instead would put its own scooters on the ground, but did not respond to requests for more information about what would be done with those scooters. Tier did say it would inherit all of Wind’s Italian staff. This article has been updated to reflect new information from Tier shared with TechCrunch."
2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/struggling-to-win-subscribers-netflix-cuts-prices-in-india/","Struggling to win subscribers, Netflix cuts prices in India","","Nearly six years after Netflix launched its service in India, the global streaming giant is still struggling to find customers willing to pay for what is already its cheapest subscription globally. The American firm on Tuesday further lowered the subscription price in India, cutting each monthly subscription tier’s cost by at least 18% and up to 60.1%. The Netflix Basic plan, which permits streaming on any device but caps the resolution at 480p, now costs <U+20B9>199 ($2.6) in India, down from <U+20B9>499 ($6.6). Netflix Standard, which improves the video resolution to HD (720p) and permits two simultaneous views, now costs <U+20B9>499, down from <U+20B9>649 ($8.5). Netflix Premium, which offers four simultaneous views and streams in UltraHD (4K) video quality, now costs <U+20B9>649, down from <U+20B9>799 ($10.5). This isn’t the first time Netflix has played around with prices in India. In 2019, after months of testing, Netflix unveiled a “mobile only” tier in India in a global first that was priced at <U+20B9>199. That plan is now available for <U+20B9>149 ($1.96), Netflix said today. Existing subscribers on any tier will be able to switch to the new offerings, the firm said. India is one of the world’s largest entertainment markets. But Netflix has struggled to produce content that helps it court customers beyond a small circle of loud Twitter users in the country — despite sinking nearly $1 billion on it to date. At the same time, Disney’s Hotstar continues to dominate the market — without much assistance from the Twitter crowd — thanks to a much larger ad-supported local content library, syndication deals with international giants such as HBO, as well as nearly all sports streaming rights. Their biggest challenger in the country remains YouTube, which per App Annie, reaches about half a billion users in the South Asian market. At roughly $20 a year for the top offerings, Disney’s Hotstar as well as Amazon Prime Video are also much more affordable to customers in India. Research firm Mobile Partners Asia estimates that India will have 89 million individuals who pay for subscription services by the end of this year, up from 57 million last year. Tuesday’s price cut in India, for which Netflix offered no explanation, comes at a time when the streaming giant has raised the monthly tariff in several parts of the world.

2021-12-14,"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/fast-groceries-startup-grovy-hopes-eastern-europe-and-sustainability-will-set-it-apart/","Fast groceries startup Grovy hopes Eastern Europe and sustainability will set it apart","","Yet another “quick commerce” 15-minute groceries startup is hoping to make a name for itself in this space, adding to the myriad companies currently crowding out this market. But Grovy is avoiding the crowded cities of Western Europe, setting its sights on becoming a daily delivery leader in the East. It’s now finalized a €3 million financing round led by Lighthouse Ventures to expand across Central and Eastern Europe, with offices already running in Prague and Bucharest, after entering the German market in Frankfurt and Mainz. While many players rely on significant markups, which can be as high as 20%, as well as low-paid gig workers, Grovy says it only employs full-time workers and leverages a 5% markup on deliveries, with a flat delivery fee that is waived for orders above €40. Its other schtick is sustainability, with deliveries only on bikes and EVs, discounts on “ugly” produce and soon-to-expire perishables (helping to cut down on food waste) and working with food waste startups such as Too Good To Go, while employing a carbon offset program. Justin Adam, co-founder and CEO of Grovy said: “Frankfurt and Mainz, with their high demand for quick commerce solutions, served as the perfect sandbox. But rather than replicate our model in other German cities, we are bringing it to larger cities across the CEE region, where 10-minute delivery is still a novelty and the potential to scale is massive.” Michal Zalesak, managing partner at lead investor Lighthouse Ventures, said: “Grovy has made achievements in mere weeks that would take a normal grocery chain a year to accomplish. Despite enormous competitive pressures, their unique approach to quick commerce has landed them phenomenal success in Germany, and we want to support them as they take on Central and Eastern Europe’s cities.” Grovy faces competition from Gorillas and Flink in Germany, and Lisek in Warsaw, but tends to face only one-hour delivery competition from the likes of Bolt or Delivery Hero in most other European cities in which it’s operating."
