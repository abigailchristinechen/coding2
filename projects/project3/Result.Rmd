# Why Awwwards?
The goal of this project is to scrape the site [**Awwwards**](https://www.awwwards.com).  It is a website primarily focused on design, creativity and innovation for various platforms like web sites, mobile sites, AR/VR and other things on the internet.  This is really interesting because we can see the design trends, and digital visuals that are considered "best" depending on different criteria like "Design", "Usability", "Content", "Creativity", "Mobile", "Developer", then there will be a "Total Rating" which will rank the site for the awards.  Awwwards, is used as a design benchmark in the design community.  Designers and non-designers use it to find inspirations for their own projects. You can also see the technologies people use as the it evolves to build their digital products like Figma, API's, PHP, Shopify, various Javascripts, Laravel, Webpack, CSS, and others.  You can also see the top Countries ranked, and you can check out which country/ agency is good in designing what kinds of interfaces.  There aren't a lot of datasets for design, and I intend to start with this to build my own datasets, with the goal of making digital design "smarter" and more "intuitive" by being powered by data.
