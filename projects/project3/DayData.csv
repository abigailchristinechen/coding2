Nevertheless Greece, despite its harsh realities,is still a place where truth, beauty and humanity exist. A place where love can thrive even in the darkest hour.  The website of “Worlds Apart” is one of the main promotional channels in Greece as well as abroad.  The main aim of the strategy in designing and developing the project was the creation of a forward thinking platform through which the movie could be promoted to all users and audience, where all audiences would find information about the production, news & contests, where promotional material can be downloaded such as wallpapers, skins for mobile advices, watch trailers of the movie, discover exclusive backstage material, as well as buy their ticket to watch it on the big screen through Village Cinemas.  The website will also represent the movie for screenings and festivals abroad as well as in B2B relations.

Chill-out mood, sometimes more intense and even a bit crazy, but always a travelling mood full of emotion! This is what we wanted to convey through the design, so we created an interactive project that changes character and feeling depending on the time of the day.  The background color and the graphic elements creating the surrounding space change shape as the hours of the day pass, thus predisposing the listeners towards a different mood.  A playful tone and a typography that liven up the content, geometric shapes and monochromatic photos that create a pleasant surprise to anyone who chooses to join Join Radio!

These pictures show the wonderful changes in nature over the seasons and are a homage to nature and its characteristic traits as well as to the city of Hanover.  The project is not a commercial one.
