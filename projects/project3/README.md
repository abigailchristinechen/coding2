# Why Awwwards?
The goal of this project is to scrape the site [**Awwwards**](https://www.awwwards.com).  It is a website primarily focused on design, creativity and innovation for various platforms like web sites, mobile sites, AR/VR and other things on the internet.  This is really interesting because we can see the design trends, and digital visuals that are considered "best" depending on different criteria like "Design", "Usability", "Content", "Creativity", "Mobile", "Developer", then there will be a "Total Rating" which will rank the site for the awards.  Awwwards, is used as a design benchmark in the design community.  Designers and non-designers use it to find inspirations for their own projects.

There aren't a lot of datasets for design, and I intend to start with this to build my own datasets, with the goal of making digital design "smarter" and more "intuitive" by being powered by data.

# Scope & Continuity 
For this project, I will be scraping the ALL of the yearly winners, monthly winners, daily winners, and nominees from Awwwards.  The data will be dating from 2011 up to December 2021. The graphs and representations here will give a very basic overview of the dataset, but I intend to continue and perform extended analysis to analyze the trends and the evolution of digital design. 

We can see the nominees, daily awardees, monthly awardees, and yearly awardees.
